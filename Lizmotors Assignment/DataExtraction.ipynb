      "History:\n",
      "Lordstown Motors was founded in 2018 by Steve Burns, former CEO of Workhorse Group . [3] On November 7, 2019, Lordstown Motors became the owner of the former GM Lordstown plant , after signing a sales agreement with automaker General Motors in May 2019. [4] [5] [6] GM loaned Lordstown Motors US$40 million in order to underwrite a substantial part of the plant purchase. [7]\n",
      "In March 2020, Lordstown Motors paid Workhorse Group US$12 million for the licensing rights to the intellectual property of the Workhorse W-15 pickup truck, with the intention of developing its own electric pickup truck based upon Workhorse's preexisting design. As part of the business deal, Workhorse Group was given a 10% equity stake in Lordstown Motors. [8] [9]\n",
      "On October 23, 2020, Lordstown reverse merged with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) named DiamondPeak Holdings and became listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. [10] The merger gave Lordstown Motors an estimated equity value of US$1.6 billion. [11] [12] On the same day, GM released Lordstown Motors from its mortgage obligations related to the purchase of the Lordstown factory. [13]\n",
      "In January 2021, the company announced the opening of a vehicle service center in Irvine , California , to support customers in the Southern California region. [14] It is Lordstown's first service center outside of Ohio, with California chosen due to \"the favorable regulatory backdrop in the state, which is aggressively promoting more widespread adoption of electric vehicles\", according to the company. [15]\n",
      "In March 2021, the investment research firm Hindenburg Research , which specializes in short-selling , published a lengthy report about Lordstown. In the report, Hindenburg presented evidence that demonstrated a history of fraud at Lordstown, with the company misleading investors by exaggerating demand and orders for its trucks, as well as Lordstown's ability to build these trucks. Hindenburg's report showed that thousands of Lordstown's claimed orders were non-binding, no-deposit indications of interest by companies without the apparent financial strength to support the size of the orders. The report also claimed significant production delays beyond Lordstown's claimed timeline with trucks three to four years away from production, stock sales by insiders amidst vehicle testing problems, and irregularities in the background of Lordstown's founder, Steve Burns. Lordstown's stock dropped 17% on the day of the news. The company responded with a statement saying, “We will be sharing a full and thorough statement in the coming days, and when we do we will absolutely be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.” [16] [17] [18] The Hindenburg Research report led to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting information from Lordstown Motors regarding the short-seller's claims of misleading investors. [19]\n",
      "It was also revealed in March 2021 that one of Lordstown's prototypes caught on fire, with the company claiming the fire was caused by \"human error\" and that the issue had been solved by Lordstown instead automating the manufacture of its vehicles. [20]\n",
      "On June 8, 2021, Lordstown Motors amended its annual report with the SEC and said that the company did not have enough money to begin commercial production of its vehicle, and that Lordstown Motors was at risk of bankruptcy. [21] Subsequently, both CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez resigned from their positions on June 14. While the official press release stated that the resignations were in anticipation of changing from research and development to production, the non-binding nature of pre-sale agreements was brought into question after revelations that the largest three purchasers were not committed to acquiring Lordstown production vehicles, and most did not have the means to do so. An independent investigation commissioned by the board found that the pre-order agreements were overstated in number and in seriousness in order to generate press. [22]\n",
      "In August 2021, veteran automobile executive Daniel Ninivaggi , former CEO of Icahn Enterprises , was named as the new CEO. [23]\n",
      "In October 2021, Lordstown Motors announced a US$230 million deal to sell the former GM plant to Foxconn Technology Group , which would become a contract assembler for the company's Endurance pickup truck. It was announced that Foxconn would also invest US$50 million in the company through a purchase of common stock. [24]\n",
      "The Foxconn deal was finalized in May 2022, and Foxconn and Lordstown Motors created a new joint-venture, MIH EV Design LLC, to develop and produce a line of EVs. [25] In addition to selling the factory to Foxconn, Foxconn was to become the contract manufacturer for Lordstown Motors’ first vehicle, the all-electric Endurance pickup truck. Foxconn's plan was to use the factory as the production hub for the proposed Fisker PEAR electric vehicle. [26]\n",
      "GM decided to end their relationship with Lordstown. Back in 2020, they had invested US$75 million in Lordstown Motors, had obtained a seat on Lordstown Motors' board of directors, and had listed Lordstown Motors in its Tier 1 [ clarification needed ] supply chain. [27] [28] Despite that, GM released public information in March 2022 that they had sold off their \"small investment\" in Lordstown Motors at the end of 2021. [29]\n",
      "In July 2022, automotive industry veteran Edward Hightower was named the new CEO. [30] In November 2022, Foxconn agreed to invest another US$170 million in Lordstown, in an effort to ramp up the production of the company's debut model. [31]\n",
      "On June 27, 2023, Lordstown sued Foxconn for failing to follow through its $170 million investment, and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as part of a plan to sell itself. [32]\n",
      "On September 27, 2023, in a bankruptcy filing, Lordstown agreed to sell assets related to the “design, production and sale of electric light duty vehicles” in the commercial fleet market to Delaware-based LAS Capital, whose majority equity holder is Lordstown founder and ex-CEO Steve Burns, for $10M. [33] On October 18, 2023, the sale was approved by the bankruptcy court, which also, after objections from the United States Justice Department, kept control of rights to pursue legal claims against Lordstown's directors with the court instead of following the new owners of the assets. [34] The sale includes all vehicles, machinery, books, records, information, files, and data and plans owned by Lordstown and the new owner will assume liability for all customer warranty, product liability, and recall obligations related to Lordstown Endurance trucks. [35]\n",
      "The Lordstown Endurance is an in-production all-wheel-drive (AWD), electric pickup truck . Its design includes independent wheel hub motors on all four wheels. The AWD hub motor system aims to reduce the number of moving parts by eschewing wheel axles and transmissions. [36] In 2019, the truck was expected to be released in the US market by late 2020, at a price of US$52,500 . [37] In November 2020, the release date was delayed, pushing the first deliveries back to September 2021, with production ramping up through 2022. [38]\n",
      "By October 2021, the announced production date for the Endurance had been delayed until no earlier than April 2022, following the September news that the Lordstown auto plant would be sold to Foxconn and that Foxconn would become the contract manufacturer of the Endurance. [39]\n",
      "In October 2021, Foxconn unveiled three new prototype vehicles: the Model C SUV scheduled to go on sale in 2023 in Taiwan, an electric bus that was planned to be tested in select cities in 2022, and a new electric sedan. [40]\n",
      "On August 4, 2022, the company admitted to further production delays for the Endurance, citing they would need to raise \"substantially more capital\" to produce the initial goal of 500 vehicles. [41]\n",
      "Lordstown Motors launched production of its Endurance pickup truck in the third quarter of 2022. In February 2023, the company issued a recall and halted production of the vehicle to address an electrical-connection issue that could lead to a loss of propulsion while driving. [42]\n",
      "In June 2023, Lordstown Motors would end the production of the Endurance and sold the project in September 2023, following their dispute with partner Foxconn and filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. [43]\n"

Motors Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results News provided by Lordstown Motors Corp. 28 Feb, 2022, 08:00 ET Share this article Share to X Share this article Share to X LORDSTOWN, Ohio , Feb. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Lordstown Motors Corp . (Nasdaq: RIDE ), (\"Lordstown Motors\" or \"LMC\"), a provider of electric light duty trucks focused on the commercial fleet market, today released its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 financial results and provided a business update. Fourth Quarter and Recent Key Business Highlights Continue Reading Lordstown Endurance electric pickup truck is targeted to launch in Q3 2022 for commercial production and sales. @2022 Lordstown Motors Corp. Ended 2021 with a cash balance of $244 million , $79 million above the midpoint of the previously issued outlook on disciplined spending, favorable working capital, additional equity issuances and a deferral of certain investments into 2022 Executed the asset purchase agreement with Foxconn to initiate the Company's strategic shift to a less capital-intensive business model focused on developing, engineering, testing and industrializing vehicles in partnership with Foxconn, with Foxconn manufacturing the Endurance in the Lordstown facility Raised $182 million in capital, comprised primarily of $100 million in down payments by Foxconn for sale of the Lordstown facility, $50 million from the sale of common stock to Foxconn and $30 million in other equity issuances; an additional $50 million down payment from Foxconn was received on January 28, 2022 Began building and testing Endurance pre-production vehicles for validation and homologation Strengthened the senior leadership team and managed a challenging operating environment throughout 2021, including the impacts of COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions Outlook Reaffirm third quarter 2022 target for commercial production and sales of the Endurance Expect commercial production and sales of the Endurance of approximately 500 units in 2022 growing to as many as 2,500 units in 2023 Anticipate investments in hard tooling and other actions to drive significant reduction in the Endurance bill of materials into 2023 and beyond Working toward finalizing the Foxconn transaction, including the contract manufacturing agreement, and seeking an agreement and funding structure to develop new vehicles in collaboration with Foxconn based off the MIH platform Continue efforts to raise additional capital to fund commercial launch of the Endurance and operating plan Executive Commentary \"The fourth quarter marked a significant strategic shift for Lordstown Motors,\" said Dan Ninivaggi , Chief Executive Officer of Lordstown , \"We executed the asset purchase agreement with Foxconn and have made substantial progress on the terms of our contract manufacturing agreement, subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS). I believe the Foxconn partnership is a critical step in unlocking the full potential of the Lordstown facility and brings multiple benefits to LMC. Our ongoing discussions with Foxconn are focused on reaching a definitive agreement for the joint development of future vehicles off the MIH platform with an appropriate funding structure to enable us to raise the necessary capital for the success of our partnership.\" \"Our organization's top priority remains bringing the Lordstown Endurance full size all-electric pickup to market as quickly and efficiently as possible,\" said Edward Hightower , President of Lordstown . \"In the fourth quarter and into 2022, we continued to build and test pre-production vehicles that we are using to complete a variety of validation activities needed to achieve full homologation. Despite ongoing challenges securing parts and other supply chain issues, we continue to target commercial production and sales in the third quarter of 2022. We have a unique vehicle that will offer a superior combination of handling, traction control, torque and turning radius that we are confident will be appreciated by our customers. With fewer moving parts than more conventional propulsion systems, we also believe the Endurance will have advantages in overall maintenance costs.\" Fourth Quarter 2021 Results In the fourth quarter, we incurred $85 million in operating expenses and $30 million in capital expenditures to continue our progress towards the commercial launch of the Endurance. We also raised $182 million in new capital, including $150 million from Foxconn in equity and down payments under the asset purchase agreement, and $30 million primarily from equity issuances under our equity purchase agreement. \"I am truly pleased by how our team navigated through 2021 given the macro headwinds, our strategic shift, and management transitions,\" said Adam Kroll , Chief Financial Officer of Lordstown . \"We exercised discipline in our spending activity, made substantial progress towards the launch of the Endurance, and invested in our people, processes and technologies. However, we understand that raising additional capital in the near term is critical to the successful launch of the Endurance and the execution of our operating plan.\" For the full year, we expended $388 million in operating cash flow and $286 million in investing, along with raising $288 million from financing activities. The capital raises consisted of the $150 million from Foxconn, $82 million from the exercise of warrants and almost $56 million from the equity purchase agreement and employee option exercises.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by words such as \"feel,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects,\" \"intends,\" \"should,\" \"is to be,\" or the negative of such terms, or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein due to many factors, including, but not limited to: our limited operating history and our significant projected funding needs; our liquidity position; the need to raise substantial additional capital to continue ongoing operations; risks associated with the conversion and retooling of our facility and ramp up of production; our inability to obtain binding purchase orders from customers and potential customers' inability to integrate our electric vehicles into their existing fleets; our inability to retain key personnel and to hire additional personnel; competition in the electric pickup truck market; supply chain disruptions; the potential inability to source essential components; our inability to develop a sales distribution network; the ability to protect our intellectual property rights; and the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. Furthermore, potential supply chain disruptions, and their consequences on testing and other activities, could present challenges that impact the timing of our commercial production. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Lordstown Motors undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release. In addition, the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals and the negotiation and execution of a contract manufacturing agreement, so there can be no assurance we will enter into a definitive joint venture agreement with Foxconn to co-design and develop vehicle programs.

Skip to main navigation Investor Relations Overview News & Events News Releases Events & Presentations Financials & Filings SEC Filings Quarterly Results Governance Management Board of Directors Documents & Charters Committee Composition Stock Info Stock Quote & Chart Historic Price Lookup IR Resources Investor FAQs Email Alerts Contact IR Management Corrective Statement News Release Details Lordstown Motors Corp. Announces Reverse Stock Split Go Back May 23, 2023 PDF Version LORDSTOWN, Ohio, May  23, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lordstown Motors Corp. (Nasdaq: RIDE), (“Lordstown Motors,” “LMC” or the “Company”), an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) of electric vehicles focused on the commercial fleet market, today announced that it will effect a 1:15 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of its Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), that will become effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on May 24, 2023 (the “Effective Time”). Lordstown Motors’ Class A common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”), under its existing symbol, “RIDE”, when the market opens on May 24, 2023. The new CUSIP number for the Company’s Class A common stock will now be 54405Q 209. The Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company’s stockholders at its 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on May 22, 2023, with the final ratio determined by the Company’s board of directors. The Company has filed an amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect the Reverse Stock Split as of the Effective Time. The Reverse Stock Split will automatically cause each 15 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding Class A common stock to be combined into one issued and outstanding share of Class A common stock. Outstanding equity-based awards and other outstanding equity rights will be proportionately adjusted. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Class A common stock will instead receive cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the closing price of the Class A common stock on Nasdaq on May 23, 2023, as adjusted to account for the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the par value or authorized number of shares of Class A common stock and will not change the par value or the authorized or outstanding number of shares of the Company’s preferred stock, including its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”). The Reverse Stock Split is intended to improve the marketability and liquidity of the Class A common stock. A higher market price can make the Class A common stock more attractive to a broader range of institutional investors, professional investors, and other members of the investing public. In addition, the Reverse Stock Split is intended to increase the per share market price of the Class A common stock in order to satisfy Nasdaq’s $1.00 minimum bid price requirement (the “Bid Price Requirement”). As previously disclosed, the Company and Foxconn (as defined below) have a dispute concerning whether the April 21, 2023 letter the Company received from Nasdaq regarding the Bid Price Requirement caused a failure of a condition to closing Foxconn’s purchase of approximately 10% of the Company’s common stock for $47.3 million. The Company believes that there was no failure of any closing condition, and the Company was ready, willing and able to close that transaction on May 8, 2023, as required by the Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) entered into by the Company on November 7, 2022 with Foxconn Ventures Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of global technology company Hon Hai Technology Group (“Foxconn”). Foxconn took a contrary position and refused to close. The Company reserves all rights against Foxconn, including rights arising out of its failure to timely close the stock purchase. If the reverse split causes the Class A common stock price to remain above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days and Nasdaq notifies the Company that the Bid Price Requirement has been satisfied, that may satisfy Foxconn’s (incorrect) interpretation of the closing condition and cause Foxconn to close the transaction. The Company remains ready, willing and able to close. No assurance can be given regarding the impact of the Reverse Stock Split on the stock price or that Foxconn will meet its obligation to close, even if the stock price remains above $1.00 for the 10 trading-day period. While the Company remains willing to negotiate with Foxconn in an effort to resolve its disputes, no agreement currently exists and the Company cannot predict whether such an agreement will be reached in the future. Since start of commercial production, the Company has completed 56 Endurance vehicles and delivered 18 to customers, 12 since resuming deliveries in late April. The Endurance continues to improve with each software update, and our team is encouraged by the most recent customer feedback. In light of the Foxconn dispute and the uncertainty regarding whether or to what extent Foxconn will fulfill its funding obligations under the Investment Agreement, the Company has taken aggressive actions to reduce costs and preserve liquidity. As of April 30, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $165 million, a decrease of approximately $11 million from the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Additional information on the Reverse Stock Split can be found in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 11, 2023, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on the Company’s website, www.lordstownmotors.com . About Lordstown Motors Corp. Lordstown Motors is an electric vehicle (“EV”) OEM developing innovative light duty commercial fleet vehicles, with the Endurance all electric pickup truck as its first vehicle and being launched in the Foxconn EV plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Lordstown Motors has engineering, research and development facilities in Farmington Hills, Michigan and Irvine, California. For additional information visit www.lordstownmotors.com . Forward-looking Statements This press release includes forward looking statements. These statements are made under the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by words such as “feel,” “believes,” expects,” “estimates,” “projects,” “intends,” “should,” “is to be,” or the negative of such terms, or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein due to many factors. With respect to the matters addressed in this press release, those factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement as a result of the Reverse Stock Split; our ability to maintain compliance with other Nasdaq listing rules; our ability to continue as a going concern, which requires us to manage costs and obtain significant additional funding; our ability to resolve our dispute with Foxconn regarding the matters asserted in the Foxconn notices and to obtain the proceeds we expected under the Investment Agreement; our ability to timely obtain necessary funding to continue our operations; our ability to continue production of the Endurance; the impact of the uncertainty with respect to our relationship with Foxconn and our prospects for additional funding on our supplier arrangements and on our employees; and risks related to the substantial costs and diversion of personnel’s attention and resources due to these matters. Other factors that may impact our results and prospects include, but are not limited to: the cost and other impacts of contingent liabilities, such as current and future litigation, claims, regulatory proceedings, investigations, complaints, product liability claims and stockholder demand letters, and availability of insurance coverage and/or adverse publicity with respect to these matters, which may have a material adverse effect, whether or not successful or valid, on our liquidity position, market price of our stock, cash projections, business prospects and ability and timeframe to obtain financing; our ability to effectively implement and realize the benefits from our transactions and agreements with Foxconn, if pending disputes are resolved, which depend on many variables that include establishment of the EV program budget and EV program milestones and satisfaction of such milestones and other conditions required to be met at the time of funding, and our ability to utilize the designs, engineering data and other foundational work of Foxconn, its affiliates, and other members of the Mobility-in-Harmony (MIH) consortium as well as other parties, and that all such parties adhere to timelines to develop, commercialize, industrialize, homologate and certify a vehicle in North America, along with variables that are out of the parties’ control, such as technology, innovation, adequate funding, supply chain and other economic conditions, competitors, customer demand and other factors; our ability to successfully address known and unknown performance, quality, supply chain and other launch-related issues, some of which are or may be material or may require additional recalls or retrofits of the Endurance, and continue commercial production and sales of the Endurance; the risk that additional elements of our technology, including our hub motors, do not perform as expected in the near or longer-term; our ability to maintain appropriate supplier relationships, including for our critical components, and the risks with respect to the terms of such arrangements due to our limited production volumes and any minimum quantity requirements, and our ability to establish our supply chain to support new vehicle programs; our ability to facilitate cost-effective production of the Endurance, which requires a strategic partner and significant additional capital, including to invest in the tooling to lower the bill of materials (“BOM”) cost, continue design enhancements and enable scaled production; our ability to execute our business plan, strategic alliances and other opportunities, including development and market acceptance of our planned products; risks related to our limited operating history, the execution of our business plan and the timing of expected business milestones, including the ability to effectively utilize existing tooling, a substantial portion of which is soft tooling not intended for long term production; our ongoing ability to secure and receive vehicle components from our supply chain in sufficient quantities to meet production volume plans and of acceptable quality to meet vehicle requirements; the availability and cost of raw materials and components, particularly in light of current supply chain disruptions and labor concerns, inflation, and the consequences of any shortages on our ability to produce saleable vehicles; our ability to successfully identify and implement actions to significantly lower the Endurance BOM cost, including identifying a strategic partner to scale the Endurance; our ability to obtain binding purchase orders and build customer relationships, and the impact of the uncertainty regarding our relationship with Foxconn has on our ability to obtain binding purchase orders; our ability to deliver on the expectations of customers with respect to the pricing, performance, quality, reliability, safety and efficiency of the Endurance and to provide the levels of after sale service, support and warranty coverage that they will require, and the impact of performance issues, production pauses and delays and recalls on consumer confidence and interest in our vehicles; our ability to conduct business using a direct sales model, rather than through a dealer network used by most other original equipment manufacturers; the effects of competition on our ability to market and sell vehicles; our ability to attract and retain key personnel and hire additional personnel particularly in light of the uncertainty regarding our Foxconn relationship; the pace and depth of electric vehicle adoption generally; our expectations regarding our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection and not infringe on the rights of others; our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals and comply with changes in laws, regulatory requirements, interpretations of existing laws and governmental incentives; the impact of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our business, the other risks we face and the actions we may take in response thereto; cybersecurity threats and breaches and compliance with privacy and data protection laws; failure to timely implement and maintain adequate financial, information technology and management processes and controls and procedures; and the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other economic, geopolitical, business and/or competitive factors, including rising interest rates, fuel and energy prices and the direct and indirect effects of the war in Ukraine. As a result of these uncertainties, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to obtain additional financing is extremely limited under current market conditions, in particular for our industry, and also influenced by other factors including the significant amount of capital required, the Foxconn dispute, the fact that the BOM cost of the Endurance is currently, and expected to continue to be, substantially higher than our selling price, uncertainty surrounding the performance of any vehicle produced by us, meaningful exposure to material losses and costs related to ongoing litigation and the SEC investigation, the Nasdaq Notice, the market price of our stock and potential dilution from the issuance of any additional securities. If we are unable to resolve our dispute with Foxconn in a timely manner on terms that allow us to continue operating as planned, identify other sources of substantial funding, identify a strategic partner and resolve our significant contingent liabilities, we may need to further curtail or cease operations and seek protection by filing a voluntary petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code. If this were to occur, the value available to our various stakeholders, including our creditors and stockholders, is uncertain and trading prices for our securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of our securities in bankruptcy proceedings, if any. Additional information on potential factors that could affect the Company and its forward-looking statements is included in the Company’s Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release.

(Nasdaq: RIDE), (“Lordstown Motors,” “LMC” or the “Company”), an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of electric vehicles focused on the commercial fleet market, today announced that it will release its fiscal year 2022 financial results before market open on Monday, March 6, 2023. The Company will then host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Lordstown Motors Corp. also announced today that it has experienced performance and quality issues with certain Endurance components that have led the company to temporarily stop production and customer deliveries since our last production update in January. The team is diligently working with suppliers on the root cause analysis of each issue and potential solutions, which in some cases may include part design modifications, retrofits, and software updates. In this regard, LMC has filed paperwork with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to voluntarily recall the Endurance to address a specific electrical connection issue that could result in a loss of propulsion while driving. Lordstown is working with its supplier network to implement a corrective action that the Company believes will address this issue. The recall will affect 19 vehicles that are either in the hands of customers or being used internally by LMC. Vehicles waiting for shipment and vehicles in process at the manufacturing plant will also be retrofitted with the corrective action once components are available. “While our experienced team has made significant progress in addressing the underlying component and vehicle sub-system issues affecting the Endurance build schedule, we remain committed to doing the right thing by our customers and to resolve potential issues before resuming production and customer shipments,” said Edward Hightower, Lordstown Motors CEO & President. LMC intends to provide a more detailed update on the status of these matters on its upcoming earnings call. About Lordstown Motors Corp.
