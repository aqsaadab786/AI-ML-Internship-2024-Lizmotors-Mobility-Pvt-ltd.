Canoo Inc.FormerlyEvelozcity (2017–2019)Company typePublicTraded asNasdaq: GOEVRussell 2000 componentIndustryAutomotiveFounded2017; 7 years ago (2017)FoundersStefan KrauseUlrich KranzHeadquartersTorrance, California, US, U.S.[1]Key peopleTony Aquila (chairman & CEO)ProductsElectric vehiclesNumber of employees805 (December 31, 2021)Websitewww.canoo.com 
Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4]


History[edit]
Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7]
In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]


Canoo Lifestyle Vehicles, all-electric minivans
Main articles: Canoo LV and Canoo MPDV
In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11]
In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14]
In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16]
In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17]
In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21]
A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22]
In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24]
In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26]
In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]


Corporate changes[edit]
On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31]
It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32]
On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34]
On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38]
On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40]
In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.
Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46]

Firm orders[edit]
On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48]
In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50]
Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56]
In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59]

Canoo (GOEV) finds path to customer deliveries by leasing Oklahoma manufacturing facility


 
Scooter Doll | Apr 10 2023 - 1:02 pm PT										

							2 Comments						









EV startup Canoo has announced a long-term lease of an existing production facility in Oklahoma City, where it will operate a full and final assembly line for its flagship Lifestyle Vehicles (LVs).

Today’s latest entry in the Canoo ($GOEV) saga should come as welcomed news for those rooting for the EV startup whose short, six-year tenure could be described as nothing short of a roller coaster ride of highs and lows.
During its Q4 earnings released last week, Canoo put a $1.5 million bookend on an SEC investigation that alleged that certain former senior executives misled investors in late 2020 and early 2021 regarding the startup’s revenue projections.
With that ordeal behind it, Canoo can focus on reaching scaled production of its LVs and Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDVs) with the $36.6 million remaining cash and equivalents it has as of December 31, 2022.
With an ever-shrinking financial runway in front of it, Canoo continues to get scrappy in order to finally achieve long-promised scaled production in Oklahoma. Today’s news brings the startup a step closer, as it looks to enter its next phase of EV development. Here’s the latest.

Canoo expands footprint in Oklahoma, nears production
According to news out of the Canoo pressroom today, it has signed a long-term lease with AFV Partners to use its vehicle manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, OK. AFV is led by executive chairman and CEO Tony Aquila, who is also the current chairman and CEO of Canoo. Aquila spoke about Canoo’s progress in The Sooner State:

One of the reasons we picked Oklahoma is because it has one of the most amazing workforces in America. They have proven themselves across many industries, including aviation and aero defense, which is why we are excited to announce our second manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, following our Vehicle Module Manufacturing Facility event on April 5, in Pryor, OK. I want to thank Mayor Holt and the people of Oklahoma City for welcoming us.

To begin, Canoo will occupy 500,000 square feet of the 630,000 sq. ft. site which already offers easy access to road, rail, and waterways, plus plenty of room for expansion on over 120 acres. The newly leased site will help Canoo employ over 500 Oklahomans who will operate the startup’s full and final assembly lines, body shop, paint shop, quality control, and vehicle testing/validation.
The lease in Oklahoma City will join a previously announced battery facility about 150 miles northeast in Pryor, OK – a facility that recently missed a construction deadline that negated up to $10 million in state incentives.
Previously, Aquila said the newly announced Oklahoma operation would allow Canoo to get a much-needed jolt to produce electric vehicles while the factory in Pryor is being built. As a result, Canoo continues to zig-zag along its path toward scaled production, but funding remains a huge factor in its success.
The company reported a net loss of $80.2 million for Q4 2022, totaling a loss of $487.7 million for the year. Looking ahead, Canoo expects operating expenses to be between $55 and $70 million with CAPEX between $30-$45 million in Q1 of 2023 as it enters the next stage of development. According to Aquila, the next phase will be “more focused on milestones versus event-based or just-in-time” that will “lower the cost, make more efficient use of capital, and allow us to focus on long term success.”
In order to stay afloat, CFO Ken Magnet said Canoo is “exploring a number of diversified funding sources,” stating that the startup can now file for options like the Department of Energy’s loan program, now that the SEC investigation has been resolved. Canoo treks forward for now.

Workhorse: Which Automobile Stock Is The Better Buy?Jan. 31, 2022 11:28 AM ETCanoo Inc. (GOEV) StockAMZN, RIVN, WKHS20 Comments3 LikesJonathan WeberInvesting Group LeaderFollowSummaryThe electric commercial vehicle market will be huge and attractive, but it will also be highly competitive.Both Workhorse and Canoo seek to become major players in that market, but Canoo might have a better shot at it due to stronger resources and no faulty products.Interest rate worries and competition from powerful peers will be an issue for both stocks.Looking for a helping hand in the market? Members of Cash Flow Kingdom get exclusive ideas and guidance to navigate any climate.  Learn More »     Petmal/iStock via Getty ImagesArticle Content Growth investments, including most EV picks, have gotten pummeled over the last couple of weeks on the back of interest rate worries. With valuations having declined considerably, a closer look at some of the smaller EV players makes sense. In this article, we'll pit Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV) and Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) against each other to see which one is more attractive at current prices. How Is Canoo Different From Workhorse? The EV industry has seen a wide range of market entrants in recent years, which includes legacy players that started to introduce EV models, but which also includes many startups that are EV pureplays. Both Workhorse and Canoo belong to the group of EV pureplays. Workhorse is a company focused on medium-duty commercial vehicles that are battery-powered. Workhorse also offers services to its customers that are operating commercial vehicle fleets, such as telematics monitoring. During its third quarter, Workhorse generated the following results: Workhorse results Q3 Workhorse presentationSales actually were negative during the quarter, although that was due to a one-time issue. Workhorse had to refund customers for faulty C-1000 vehicles. In previous quarters, WKHS didn't generate especially high revenue, either, however. During the second quarter, for example, Workhorse generated revenue of $1.2 million, which isn't nearly enough to cover the company's expenses. During the third quarter, Workhorse reported total expenses of around $25 million, before interest expenses and other losses, such as the loss on the sale of its LMC investment. Workhorse operates with a current cash burn rate of around $15 million per month, which is quite meaningful for a company with a market capitalization that does not have overly large financial resources. Workhorse is currently producing two units of its C-series truck per week, which makes for annual production numbers of around 100 vehicles. Clearly, at least for now, Workhorse is not in a position where production and sales are anywhere close to levels where they are economically viable in the long run. Workhorse is confident that it will manage to turn the company's operations around and that it will be a leading company in the transition of commercial vehicle fleets towards being electricity-powered. The market opportunity for Workhorse is great, of course. There are many millions of commercial vehicles on the road today, and that number will only grow going forward. Trends such as growing e-commerce sales, that require delivery vehicles, or growing consumption in high-growth countries such as India or China will result in more and more commercial vehicles being used around the globe. At the same time, due to companies being interested in lowering their emissions, and due to governments/authorities demanding lower emissions to combat global warming and air pollution, a growing number of these commercial vehicles will be powered by electricity. A lot of market potential alone doesn't make WKHS a great investment, however, as it is not guaranteed that WKHS will be among the future leaders in this high-growth and high-value market. Canoo is a diversified electric mobility company that is active in commercial and consumer markets. Like Workhorse, it seeks to become a major player in the emerging, high-value electric commercial vehicle market. Unlike Workhorse, Canoo is still in a pre-revenue stage, as it has not sold any vehicles yet. The company has a credible plan of bringing its first EVs to the market in the foreseeable future, however. Canoo is, unlike Workhorse, not entirely focused on commercial vehicles. Instead, the company plans to use its architecture for a range of vehicles in order to grow the total addressable market: Canoo outlook Canoo presentationPer management, the total addressable market is north of four million vehicles by now, although that alone does not make Canoo a buy, just like with WKHS. For now, the company seems to be on track to deliver vehicles in the foreseeable future, but commercial success is far from guaranteed. Is Canoo Larger Than Workhorse? The answer to this question depends on how you define size. On a revenue and sales basis, Workhorse is the larger among these two, although even WKHS is pretty small in terms of the number of vehicles it has delivered so far and will be delivering this year. In terms of market capitalization, Canoo is the larger company by far: Data by YChartsCanoo's market capitalization is around 3x as high as that of Workhorse, while Canoo's enterprise value is roughly 2x as high as that of Workhorse. GOEV has significantly larger cash reserves (on a net basis), at around $460 million, versus $70 million at WKHS. This explains why there is a larger difference between market capitalization and enterprise value at Canoo. At the same time, the larger cash reserves make Canoo the less risky pick, I believe, as Canoo has larger resources that can be used for ramping up production in the future -- although it is unlikely that the ~$0.5 billion of cash will be enough to bring the company to a size where it can self-fund all future growth. Workhorse, with its lower cash resources, is even less likely to get to a size where it can self-fund future growth before having to raise new money via debt or a secondary offering. Who Are GOEV And WKHS' Competitors? Looking at manufacturers of electric commercial vehicles only, there are still a number of potent competitors worth noting. Rivian (RIVN), for example, has a deal with Amazon (AMZN) to order 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, making it pretty much a sure bet that Amazon alone will buy commercial vehicles worth billions of dollars from Rivian. This is a pretty strong endorsement for Rivian's product, and coupled with billions of dollars in cash that Rivian has on its balance sheet, it seems like a leading competitor for Canoo and Workhorse. Amazon has also ordered electric vehicles from other companies, however. This includes legacy players such as Stellantis (STLA) and Daimler (OTCPK:DMLRY), which naturally have vast resources, making them viable competitors in this space as well. On top of that, there are other EV pureplays with commercial vehicles on the market or in the works, such as Berkshire Hathaway-backed BYD (OTCPK:BYDDY). With in-house battery development and production, and significant experience in ramping up the production of EVs, BYD is, I believe, an important and capable competitor as well. EV king Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also seeks to become a player in the commercial vehicles industry with its Tesla Semi, although that is not a delivery vehicle primarily. In short, there is a wide range of competitors, many of those being highly capable, experienced manufacturers with large resources (personnel and financial). This has to be expected in a high-value market with lots of growth potential, though. Is GOEV Or WKHS The Better Buy? Both companies are seeking to make a splash in the large and growing commercial vehicles market, but I do believe that their outlook differs. Neither company is profitable (in fact, quite far from it), but Canoo clearly is the company with better resources. Canoo's cash position, per its most recent 10-Q filing, is more than $400 million, and the company will benefit from financial incentives for building out its assets in Oklahoma and Arkansas. Workhorse, by comparison, has a little more than $230 million of cash on its balance sheet today, which will make it harder for the company to invest in its growth going forward. On top of that, doing a secondary offering is not a great choice for Workhorse, due to the company's low market capitalization. Even raising just another $200 million would dilute current shareholders by around 50%, whereas Canoo, with its higher market cap, could raise additional funds more easily. Canoo's platform that allows for a range of vehicles being developed at the same time, including consumer vehicles and commercial vehicles, has advantages: Canoo vehicles Canoo websiteWith a larger addressable market, Canoo could be able to generate higher sales compared to Workhorse, which has a more narrow focus. On top of that, developing one platform and using it for more than one vehicle will allow for some cost synergies, as R&D expenses are distributed over several products, which could result in more attractive margins once operations are scaled up. Canoo is, thanks to its better financing and larger product portfolio, forecasted to generate significantly higher revenue compared to Workhorse: Data by YChartsIn fact, WKHS's revenue estimate has declined rapidly over the last half-year or so, as operational problems, such as the C-1000 recall, got factored into analyst models. Investing in a startup that is at a pre-revenue stage is always risky, but it seems like risks are higher at Workhorse compared to Canoo, even though Canoo isn't a low-risk pick, either. Due to a more attractive product portfolio, better liquidity, and better execution (no premature deliveries of faulty vehicles), Canoo looks like the better pick to me. I do not think that it is necessarily a buy, however. The commercial vehicles market will remain highly competitive, and it is far from guaranteed that a new market entrant will be successful, especially since competitors such as Rivian, Daimler, etc. have huge resources compared to Canoo. From a timing perspective, it also seems that investors might be better off not entering a position in either Canoo or Workhorse today. Both companies have seen their shares drop in recent weeks due to interest rate worries and a general bear market in ""speculative growth"" stocks. It is definitively possible that this selling pressure persists, which is why staying on the sidelines could be a wise idea until investors have a clearer picture of the production ramp and possible needs for additional capital raises.  All in all, I'd thus say that Canoo is the better pick among these two companies, but that does not mean that buying Canoo today must be the best choice. Instead, keep an eye on Canoo, but wait for the current market turmoil to shake out and wait until we get a clearer picture about the production ramp could be an advisable strategy.

The car is going in production next year. The company is currently valued around 20 Million Euro. Now that is a bargain and a potential 100 bagger worth taking the risk. Canoo and Workhorse are not (in my opinion).ReplyLike(1)GGettingReal01 Feb. 2022Investing GroupComments (294)@Collegiatus Not all of them. Yes, WKHS, NKLA, HLYN prices were built on hype and crashed accordingly. But you might want to take a look at Lion Electric (LEV) and Proterra (PTRA). Both have been dragged down with the rest but both have real products, real orders, and are ramping up manufacturing capacity. Also if you want a play on EV buses, look at New Flyer (NFI-T). They're a legacy bus company with serious manufacturing capacity who are switching rapidly to EVs. They just won a major order from Toronto Transit. their stock is down 'cos of supply chain issues, but I think it's temporary. Large transit buses btw can often run at $1M a pop, so margins are often better than commercial delivery vehicles.ReplyLike(1)Collegiatus02 Feb. 2022Investing GroupComments (576)@GettingReal I know and I own a few of them: Nikola (I like their business plan plus financial partners) and Greenpower Motors, a few Nios.

They literally do everything they can to NOT get broad exposure. In contrary to certain other EV startups (looking at you Fisker).Talking about product. Many other EV startups go straight from Beta to production, and then get into trouble with the first car batches. Canoo takes one full year for their Gamma production (after >600K miles with Beta), also known as finetuning proces. That people don't believe that Canoo will ever get a car on the road, is understandable, unless you actually take a deep look in the company. So the current negative sentiment is not surprising, but this just increases the upside even further when the first cars drive on the roads in Q4.ReplyLikeGGettingReal31 Jan. 2022Investing GroupComments (294)WKHS is surely walking dead at this point.

Anyway while of course risky, a lot of the negative talk on Canoo is sour grapes perhaps, as the former CEO went to Apple, and too many focus on the still-pending Oklahoma factory, rather than the 'leased' building in Bentonville AK that will likely pump-out the first models later this year. Canoo's CEO Tony also has a huge personal investment; which is encouraging. Sure, they'll likely have to raise funds (or get a partner, we wish Walmart, but who knows..) down the line, but that's fine if they're cooking. Someone suggested merging with Nikola, to form a company called 'Canola', but that's an oil (haha). Really I like the design; the awards reflect that; and they just need to execute and get products that work reliably out there. In which case this is extremely cheaply priced, as the speculative excess from the early hype has been wrung out in our view; but again as one of several speculative plays (not a big concentration like we also did in Ford at 12 and continue to hold). GOEV at 5-6 is a buy and as it briefly broke 5 I thought it was a screaming buy then.ReplyLike(2)KKhalid Hawthorne01 Feb. 2022Comments (180)@stockseer1 Agreed...I'm barely holding as other opportunities get cheaper.

The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue. 
Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews.
“Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup.
Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. 
On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.”
Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. 
“Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)”
She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” 
“And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.  
Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. 
As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.”
But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comBig dealDeloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.Going deeper""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey.

As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading.Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc.

The company came public last December following a SPAC merger. On March 29, they released their first financial quarterly report, and it is fair to say that investors weren't happy with the updates that management gave. The company announced a fundamental shift in its go-to-market strategy, away from contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and away from its subscription-model towards focusing on commercial EV opportunities. Shares of Canoo were hit hard after the report, and are down about 65% from the $20 highs we saw back in Jan/Feb, while the company's market cap shrunk to only $1.75bn as of this writing, one of the lowest from a basket of EV upstarts. Data by YCharts The Canoo Story Prior To Q4 Results When Canoo announced in August 2020 to go public via SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition IV, management laid out an aggressive go-to-market strategy that built on two key pillars: one was the licensing and contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and secondly, the company also planned to sell its different EV-types (including a lifestyle and a multi-purpose delivery vehicle) directly to consumers via a monthly subscription (B2C). For their delivery vehicle the company aims at directly selling them to business in a B2B approach. The focus on these pillars was strongly presented in its SPAC presentation (see some excerpts below): Source: Company presentation The company also put significant focus on the commercial relevance of its contract manufacturing & engineering capabilities, on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology.  Source: Company presentation Both business segments would use the underlying multi-purpose skateboard technology which essentially is a flat, drivable rolling chassis that contains the electrical architecture necessary for EVs. The beauty of the manufacturing approach on the basis of the skateboard is that the vehicle body just needs to be assembled on top of the skateboard, a so-called ""top hat design"" approach, which is expected to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce cost and time to market. According to management the skateboard technology would be the first true steer-by-wire solution that would come to market, which would be an important differentiator from competitor offerings.  It needs to be mentioned here that also other EV manufacturers are working on similar technology concepts, including REE Automotive, which is going public through a SPAC with 10x Capital Venture Acquisition (VCVC), and private-company Rivian Automotive (RIVN). Canoo was planning to contract these manufacturing capabilities to other car manufacturers. Furthermore, management also pivoted towards selling its in-house developed cars via a potentially revolutionary approach, by offering a subscription plan that management claimed would be significantly different from a traditional lease and cost-efficient compared to an ownership model. And the company's plans should not stop here. Management also intended to sell its multi-purpose delivery vehicle in a B2B approach to capture share in the last-mile delivery market, while arguing that the delivery vehicle would offer best-in-class total cost of ownership, cargo volume (30% more parcel volume vs. current options), and functionally-designed features, compared to current delivery-vehicle solutions, possibly enabling up to $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles (Source). The refreshing approach and multiple revenue streams that Canoo's management presented to investors, and the pivot away from the car industry's regular business model definitely drove some of the optimism and hype towards the company. While these were all nice promises, high hopes got crushed when the company announced its first results as a public company. Major Strategy Changes Announced In Q4 Results When Canoo announced its first earnings report as a public company on March 29th, the first surprise for many investors was that the company announced key changes to its leadership team. It was announced that Chief financial officer Paul Balciunas would leave the company. Canoo also announced on April 22nd that Tony Aquila will also take on the role of Chief Executive Officer replacing former CEO Ulrich Kranz, who has resigned effective April 30, 2021. While it is not clear as to why former CEO Ulrich Kranz resigned, it gives some bitter taste to the story and we definitely don't like the high leadership turnover. But these were not the only announcements that put pressure on Canoo's stock. The company announced a number of changes, including that it would no longer pursue the contract engineering part of its business. The reason was that the company wants to protect its intellectual property which it seemingly would not be able to do by licensing it to other manufacturers. On the conference call, analyst Craig Irwin asked about the conflicting statements that management gave:    Craig Irwin: Okay. The second question there - there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was - it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license. Tony Aquila: Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started - I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value.  While the answer from Tony Aquila eluded to potential IP leakage and the concerns management had that this approach would not be driving the best shareholder value, we are not very happy with the contradictory explanation. This is especially concerning in light of the fact that Canoo initially planned to generate revenue from the contract manufacturing segment of >$500 million by 2025, with a CAGR of 39% between 2021 and 2025 (see our calculation here). It's dubious to us why management now suddenly makes a U-turn when the management team should not have provided such bloated numbers leading to its SPAC deal just to give potential investors false promises on what many investors saw as a key differentiator vs. competition. The announced change on the contract engineering front also undermines all hopes from Canoo's earlier announced partnership with Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) while it also puts to rest any hopes for a potential deal with Apple (AAPL). Again, management didn't give a clear answer to questions on their plans during the conference call when asked by analysts:    Joseph Spak: Okay. Well, last one for me, just going back to the decision to deemphasize engineering with the Hyundai arrangement the original one, which I'm assuming that that's now off the table. But if you go back to that release, did say Hyundai gains access to technology, you mentioned IP leakage is one of the potential problems with that arrangement. Can you just talk about, like how do you unwind that sort of memorandum of understanding what work was done? Do you think there was any IP leakage obviously Hyundai is coming out with their own electric vehicle platforms as well? Tony Aquila I think what happened is pretty kind of case in point. So I think the company, just like any adolescent companies, it's learning its way and all of us go through it. But it factored in contract manufacturing based on the labor of engineers, not based on the value of IP, which would have changed the value of that contract significantly. And look, we have experience in this area and we're very focused on if we do work, one, we can protect our IP and we can get the residual value of that in addition to. So it's kind of caused us to say, hey, let's put that on hold. We have so much demand for our three derivatives. Let's get all that work done. And then let's, look at if there is partnerships, partnerships can work in this industry. But contract manufacturing work is as you know is not the best business line to be in.  The announced changes in Canoo's strategy don't stop here as management also mentioned that the previously announced subscription model for its direct-to-consumer offerings (lifestyle and sports vehicle) will now only be optional, and are expected to only account for a small part of its revenue going forward, especially since the consumer business will be de-emphasized in favor of commercial opportunities. This is a significant strategy shift as the company initially forecasted subscription revenue to reach almost $2 billion by 2026 (see forecast below). So again, why did management not get to the realization earlier that this would not be the most promising path?  Source: company presentation With all these changes, Canoo is now a fundamentally changed story and a perfect example of why investors should be cautious to believe in pre-SPAC projections. We have made a similar mistake by putting too much trust into management's projections. While we always took a very careful stance at the company's projections, the significant U-turn lead is to sell our shares over the past weeks. What Wall Street Is Saying Wall Street seems to agree that the fundamental changes in Canoo's business model create many uncertainties to say the least:  Bank of America (BAC) initiated coverage of Canoo stock with an ""underperform"" rating challenging the company's ""ability to execute in a timely fashion"" in light of ""several significant pivots/changes"" in its business model. BofA gives Canoo a $6 / share price target - suggesting further downside on the already sluggish stock performance.  Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin downgraded Canoo from Buy to Neutral with a price target of $12.00 citing that ""Canoo had an eventful call for its first post SPAC-IPO results. We are downgrading shares of Canoo to Neutral (from Buy) given a hard pivot in the business model and a reset on operations, which are clearly still ongoing. The difficult part is where the pivot points after the reset, as Canoo has (1) de-emphasized eng'g services done for others, (2) pushed back from the subscription model for the lifestyle vehicle, and (3) replaced its CFO and VPCorp. Strategy.""  Our Verdict On GOEV Stock The recently announced changes imply a fundamental shift in the business and go-to-market strategy. While the core technology of Canoo's multi-purpose platform did not change, it remains a big question mark how the company will use this technology to generate revenue besides in-house manufacturing when they are shying away from building up a contract engineering business. Canoo remains only one very small player amongst many upstarts within the highly competitive EV industry. So deemphasizing potential revenue-generating partnerships will not only create a cash-problem going forward, but will also take off some of the buzz that was generated around the Hyundai, as well as the potential Apple partnership. The recent strategy changes create a high level of uncertainty as to how the company will finally be able to generate revenue. Canoo's business model is currently no more refined or differentiated than it was at its inception. In fact, it appears that management is not sure themselves what the best route to commercialization is. While several of the announced changes could be regarded as logical, i.e. the pivot towards commercial opportunities, the changes introduce further risk around the company's ability to execute. While it's probably worth asking as to how much the initial story really changed it is a fact that two main pillars of the company's initial forecast, i.e. contract engineering and car-subscriptions, which together accounted for a combined total of around $2.5bn in revenue until 2026, will simply be eliminated from the forecast.  Since so much has changed and the path to revenue generation is increasingly unclear, we are distancing ourselves from Canoo stock for the foreseeable future. But Canoo's management may still prove their critics wrong with what's left of the company: an intriguing underlying technology and a market cap that is below the initial SPAC valuation and significantly smaller compared to many of its high-flying peers. However, this is simply too much of a gamble for us. So we will be staying on the sidelines on Canoo stock after selling all our shares over the past weeks.This article was written byNestEgg Research928 FollowersFollowOur research focusses on high growth, disruptive businesses and industries in the tech sector. We hope to provide you with some useful insights for your own research.

As far as their sales projections referenced in this piece, as anyone with any experience in start-ups knows, those numbers are typically unreliable, to put it charitably (bogus is a more correct term). I have a few warrants, way under water now, we shall see how this goes in 2-3 years. For sure, many of these EV start-ups will fail, that is the nature of start-ups.ReplyLikekkurtbro29 May 2021Comments (360)I think the trucks look great, futuristic and cool.ReplyLikeESP equity research26 May 2021AnalystPremiumComments (9.16K)Yes I sold all my shares after the ""pivot"" as well.

Subscription will work great for densely populated areas in California where the average family struggles to pay for a rented 2B/1Ba and a car. However, as an average consumer in a normal American city, I just want a small electric truck. I will pre-order the Canoo Truck as soon as possible, as even Ford has forgotten that not everyone wants a full-size pickup, and refuses to purchase a brand new, yet already outdated combustion vehicle.The current share price speaks volumes, but I predict that you will reverse this opinion within 2 years or less. Tony Aquila is playing all of us, and is ready to reveal the trick very soon.ReplyLike(4)NestEgg Research16 May 2021AnalystInvesting GroupComments (333)@Error Blindside thanks for your comment and perspective. Its a difficult thing to say whether that’s the right move or not. With the subscription it might be, but the contract engineering we are not so sure about. But maybe the take an opportunistic approach here as well. Let’s see what management will tell us on the conference call, and hope they can proof us wrong so.

Per 4Q20 conference call, Management came straight out and basically said everything from subscription model, to partnerships, to production, etc... etc... all being looked at again.  Good management re-examines.  Canoo is re-examining everything.  Canoo is not just stuck on doing things one way in a rushed manner.  Canoo is a dynamic company producing a brilliant lineup of BEV vehicles on its own terms and its own timeline.  If investors can't see the dynamitc nature of Canoo, then maybe go invest in some other company.ReplyLike(7)NestEgg Research15 May 2021AnalystInvesting GroupComments (333)@Frank Thomas in Florida Not saying that these changes might not be exactly what’s needed. Just a little bit too much of a strategy change for us. Hoping for you and all investors they proof us wrong! Have a good weekendReplyLike(2)toddsearlesusa14 May 2021Comments (5)While I appreciate your thoughts and insight, and I certainly understand that these changes rattled a few cages, I think the changes are precisely what Canoo needed to be successful. The past CEO was grossly ill-equipped to manage a public company on a going forward basis, and while the subscription model was unique, it was significantly flawed in many regards. It is also my understanding that the subscription model has not been eliminated entirely, but it will be reconfigured and incorporated as a much smaller component of the overall financial strategy. I think Tony with a (new) superior senior management team will drive positive results far superior to Ulrich. Good or Bad, Hard to Say... Hopefully, Monday's earnings and subsequent call will provide much needed clarity for all of us.ReplyLike(3)NestEgg Research15 May 2021AnalystInvesting GroupComments (333)@toddsearlesusa thanks for your comment and perspective!

So would you argue that the strategy shift was right?ReplyLikeZifangsun15 May 2021Comments (1.46K)@NestEgg Research ,Yes, I would.Subscription model requires a great deal of capital. You have to make it before you can rent it, and you get the money back slowly. Where can Canoo get that kind of money without severely diluting common shares ?Xiaopeng (XPEV) raised $4B expanding outstanding shares from 250M to 750m.Canoo built Beta level Engineering Prototypes in 19 months. That implies an outstanding Engineering Team. IP is The Core Value of Canoo. Why sell it sheap through Engineering Service?One platform, multiple hats. That’s the model for Purpose-Built Vehicles. The market should be Small Business, not for personal use.Again, my 2cents.ReplyLike(4)Zifangsun15 May 2021Comments (1.46K)Allow me to illustrate my point through the Food Truck business.At Taiwan, my hometown, we have 46,000 mobile Food Stalls, called Night Market. Nobody cooks in Taiwan. Everybody eats outside, 3 meals a day. Most food stalls are in the local markets, also distributed within the city.Out of the population of 2.3M, there is one mobile food stall for 500 residents. Each stall can be replaced by one food truck. If all are replaced in 5 years, annual sale would be 10,000 food trucks.If we apply that to China market. With the population of 1.4B, annual sale would be 600,000 food trucks,  more than what Tesla did last year.And that’s only about food, a typical market has much more varieties.Canoo was originally funded by a Chinese, and perhaps still is Canoo’s biggest share holder. His father-in-law was a very high level Chinese Official. I think Canoo would do well in China.ReplyLike(5)wwakawaka14 May 2021Investing GroupComments (1.37K)Well, I understand your concerns but i can see Canoo outperforming the ev industry in the coming years.. its just my gut.

Published: 12 Feb 2024


 
The constantly evolving marketing landscape requires successful marketers to keep abreast of emerging trends. Understanding and adapting to these trends -- driven by the often-clashing forces of technological advancements, consumer behaviors, market dynamics and global events -- is essential for marketers to maintain a competitive edge in today's fast-paced, digital-centric world.








By paying close attention to and learning from these trends, astute marketers gain valuable insights into their consumers' evolving needs, preferences and behavior patterns. Better still, they provide their companies with more effective, targeted and personalized marketing strategies.
To unlock new avenues of growth, marketers must experiment with new tools and technologies, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for personalized marketing, as well as employing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for immersive customer experiences.
Here's a look at key market trends in 2024, their central role in driving innovation and growth, and how these trends, if properly understood and harnessed, make brands more resilient within their unique marketplaces and against an ever-growing competitive landscape.

1. Artificial intelligence and machine learning
AI and ML are poised to significantly influence marketing trends this year and beyond because they streamline and personalize consumer experiences. In 2023, the Sprout Social Index found that 81% of marketers say AI has had a positive impact on their work and that it also helps in creative areas such as content planning and productivity. AI and ML automate some repetitive tasks, freeing marketers to focus on strategy and creative initiatives. Moreover, these technologies analyze vast amounts of data to glean insights for a more targeted, efficient marketing strategy adaptable to changing consumer behavior patterns.
AI and ML also excel at personalizing the customer journey by tailoring ads and product recommendations, as well as predicting future consumer behavior. In this instance, AI algorithms process a customer's past behavior, social media interactions and other data to forecast their future actions, allowing companies to cater proactively to their preferences.
Finally, AI and ML contribute to more effective customer segmentation. Instead of relying on broad demographic information, these technologies partition customers based on nuanced behavioral patterns and preferences. This allows brands to create highly tailored marketing campaigns that resonate with specific customer groups.


2. Voice search optimization
As the adoption of smart speakers and voice-activated devices continues to rise, the shift to voice search optimization is expected to continue, underpinned by consumer preference for hands-free, voice-activated technology. Additionally, with advancements in natural language processing and AI, voice search technology delivers more accurate and personalized responses, which contribute to a positive user experience.
The increased prevalence of voice search also brings about a significant change to the search engine optimization (SEO) landscape. Traditional keyword strategies require reevaluation as voice searches typically involve more conversational and long-tail phrases. Moreover, the ""position zero"" or featured snippet on search engine results pages becomes even more desirable since voice assistants often pull their responses from these highlights. Hence, marketers need to adapt their SEO strategies to ensure their content is voice search-friendly and capable of earning that coveted spot.
Furthermore, voice commerce represents a promising frontier for businesses. As consumers become more comfortable using voice commands to complete a range of tasks, the leap to voice-activated purchasing is natural. Brands that optimize their content for voice search are better positioned to tap into this emerging market, driving sales and enhancing customer convenience.


3. Increased use of chatbots
The increase in the use of chatbots, including both AI-powered and rules-based versions, is a compelling trend for several reasons. First, chatbots offer companies a cost-efficient, round-the-clock customer service solution. They can handle multiple customer queries simultaneously, providing immediate responses and improving customer satisfaction levels. AI-powered chatbots learn from every interaction, enabling them to deliver increasingly personalized responses over time and enhance user engagement.Second, chatbots are highly versatile marketing tools, used not only for customer service but also for product recommendations, appointment scheduling and lead qualification. This versatility becomes increasingly valuable as businesses seek to maximize their online engagement. Additionally, rules-based chatbots provide a consistent, reliable service that's adaptable to a brand's specific requirements, making them a preferable option for companies that deal with straightforward customer queries.
Third, along with increasing customer engagement and potential revenue for businesses, chatbots save company resources -- both time and dollars.


4. Personalized marketing
Brands that engage in personalized marketing create a bond with their audience, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Unlike generic marketing, personalized marketing speaks directly to the customer, addressing that individual's unique needs and preferences. This shift to building trusting relationships and providing a better customer experience promises increased conversions, customer retention and, ultimately, revenue growth.
Additionally, with advancements in AI and ML technologies, the possibilities for personalization are expanding. Brands can analyze customer behaviors and preferences in real time, allowing them to finetune marketing efforts to each customer. This leads to more effective and efficient marketing strategies, as resources are concentrated on the most impactful channels and methods, ultimately improving return on investment (ROI).


5. Video marketing
The ubiquity of internet connectivity and the ever-increasing power of modern smartphones have made video content more accessible than ever before. Consumers can now stream high-quality video on the go, making it a powerful tool to catch their attention and deliver impactful messages. Moreover, platforms such as TikTok, as well as features like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts have popularized short-form video content, driving brands to adopt this format to reach and engage their audience.
In addition, video content offers a unique blend of audiovisual elements that allows marketers to tell more engaging and persuasive stories, helping their products and services stand out in a saturated market. Video content can seamlessly incorporate customer testimonials, product demonstrations, behind-the-scenes insights and many other elements that build trust and cultivate a deeper connection with the audience or even encourage purchases.
Lastly, video marketing impacts key metrics such as SEO, conversion and click-through rates. Research shows that incorporating videos into marketing emails can boost click-through rates, while embedding videos on landing pages can increase conversion rates. Indeed, successful video marketing in 2024 aligns with the data-driven approach that modern marketing strategies strive to adopt.


6. Social commerce
By enabling direct purchases within the same social media apps where consumers connect, share and inspire each other, social commerce platforms are transforming the shopping journey into a seamless, convenient experience. With features ranging from shoppable posts to in-app stores, brands have the opportunity to target and convert consumers within a familiar social context, effectively shortening the path to purchase.
Moreover, social commerce leverages the power of user-generated content and peer-to-peer influence, key elements in today's consumer decision-making process. Consumers can see how products look in real life, read reviews and even make inquiries to brands through direct messages, all in one platform. This immersive, interactive shopping experience, coupled with the ability to instantly share and discuss products with friends and followers, amplifies word-of-mouth marketing and encourages impulsive buying behaviors. As such, social commerce is expected to keep its momentum in the marketing landscape and can be used in conjunction with a marketing team's growing omnichannel customer experiences.


7. Influencer marketing
This marketing trend establishes an authentic connection with audiences that traditional advertising struggles to achieve. Influencers have a strong rapport with their followers, which makes their promotional content more engaging, relatable, impactful and trustworthy.
The intersection of influencer marketing, video content, and social commerce creates a potent combination for brands. As consumers continue to shop directly from social media platforms, influencers tap into this trend by creating engaging video content showcasing products, encouraging their followers to click through and make a purchase. This seamless integration of shopping and social media amplifies the efficacy of influencer marketing and underlines its importance in a company's marketing strategies.





8. Sustainable and ethical marketing
The continued adoption of sustainable and ethical marketing reflects a growing consumer consciousness around environmental impact and social issues. As people become increasingly informed and concerned about the biosphere, the ethical and sustainability practices of a business come into sharp focus for discerning would-be consumers. It's an opportunity for businesses to differentiate themselves, align with consumer values and forge stronger connections with their customer base.
In addition, companies adopting sustainable and ethical marketing practices gain a competitive advantage. Research shows that consumers are willing to pay a premium for products and services from companies committed to positive social and environmental impact. As such, sustainable and ethical marketing is not just a trend, but a strategic approach likely to drive consumer behavior and loyalty.


9. Virtual reality and augmented reality
VR and AR technology will be adopted by more businesses in 2024, transforming how companies interact with their customers, especially as it becomes more accessible to small- and medium-sized businesses. These immersive technologies offer an entirely new level of engagement, allowing consumers to experience products or services in a simulated environment before purchase. This not only enhances the customer's understanding of the product, but it also creates a memorable, engaging experience that increases brand loyalty.
In addition, AR and VR provide marketers with innovative ways to tell their brand stories. For instance, AR can overlay digital information on physical products or locations, providing an interactive experience. Meanwhile, VR can transport users to entirely new environments -- a virtual showroom or exotic location tied to a brand's narrative -- and even show how furniture or other large fixtures would fit in a specific room. These technologies change the dynamics of customer engagement and experience.


10. Big data and analytics
Marketers realize that comprehensive, accurate data can provide invaluable insights into customer behavior, preferences and trends. The ability to capture and analyze such vast volumes of data enables businesses to anticipate market changes, predict customer behavior and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly, leading to improved efficiency and higher ROI.
The convergence of machine learning and big data is opening up new vistas in predictive analytics, allowing for more precise customer segmentation and targeting. With sophisticated analytics tools, marketers can derive actionable insights and make more informed decisions, from identifying the most effective marketing channels to optimizing campaign performance. Thus, leveraging big data and analytics is not a new trend, it's a fundamental shift in the marketing landscape.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape.Gather information on Canoo's financial performance, including its revenue, profit margins, return on investment, and expense structure.",Four trends in consumer behavior in 2023 | McKinsey,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-world-of-ands-consumers-set-the-tone,"Four trends in consumer behavior in 2023 | McKinsey

Skip to main contentThe world of ‘ands’: Consumers set the toneJune 8, 2023 | Commentary Sajal KohliConsumer behaviors are diverging in sometimes paradoxical directions. How can companies quickly detect—and respond to—these trends?  (4 pages)
This is an edited version of a presentation given at the Consumer Goods Forum in Kyoto, Japan, on June 7, 2023.
Leading consumer-facing businesses place a lot of emphasis on listening to consumers, as they should. Consumer sentiment and behavior can be fast changing, confusing, and sometimes contradictory. Today’s consumers, for instance, are both trading down and selectively splurging. They’re buying big, established brands and exploring newer, smaller ones. Many of their buying decisions are a matter of “and,” not “or.”
Staying attuned to these trends in consumer behavior can be difficult for companies, but doing so is absolutely critical—even (or perhaps especially) when the ands seem paradoxical. Quick decision making on how to meet consumers’ expectations in this world of ands must be at the top of a company’s agenda.
In addition, businesses must prioritize a series of ands themselves to grow profitably and outperform competitors. This article outlines the ands that we see playing out in consumer behavior, along with the ands that business leaders need to act on.
Four trends in consumer behavior
Many of the insights I’ll be sharing with you are powered by ConsumerWise, McKinsey’s proprietary solution that tracks and analyzes both consumer sentiment (what consumers say and how they feel) and consumer spending (what they actually do)—thus providing a 360-degree view of today’s consumers. ConsumerWise currently spans ten markets; by the end of 2023 it will expand to 20 markets, covering 90 percent of global GDP. Our latest ConsumerWise research reveals that consumers are engaging in the following four ands. It also reveals that trade-offs are false choices.
Trading down and splurging selectively

Consumers are both flocking to value and buying premium products and services. Worldwide, approximately two in three consumers are trading down by buying cheaper brands or private-label products. In Europe, 84 percent of consumers perceive branded products as having similar quality to private labels. In China, consumers are becoming more value conscious and aggressively seeking discounts and promotions.
At the same time, 44 percent of consumers around the world (and 60 percent of Gen Zers and millennials) say that they plan to splurge, particularly on purchases that are experiential or provide immediate gratification—think restaurants or travel. Regionally, intent to splurge closely aligns with economic optimism: 77 percent of Indian consumers plan to splurge, compared with only 26 percent of Japanese consumers. In short, consumer spending is falling globally, and midpriced goods and services are most at risk. Shoppers who splurge in some categories may seek value in others, which means companies must develop a detailed and nuanced understanding of trends and segments.
Shopping everywhere and all at once
The majority of consumers now use at least three channels for each purchase journey. And while 75 percent of consumers want a seamless omnichannel experience, only 25 percent are satisfied with the experience that retailers provide. Omnichannel excellence is especially important given that omnichannel consumers are at least 1.25 times more valuable than their single-channel counterparts.
Consumers are also increasingly adopting new shopping channels. More than 60 percent of US and Asian consumers plan to continue using channels that they first tried during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as grocery delivery or social commerce.
Finding comfort in familiarity and exploring brand promiscuity
Traditionally, big brands have dominated the consumer landscape, especially during times of uncertainty. In the US market, big brands grew 50 percent at the height of the pandemic. But consumers are also trying new brands: one in three consumers did so in the past three months. Gen Zers and millennials are especially susceptible to brand switching, as they are five times more likely than older generations to believe that newer brands are better or more innovative than established brands.
In general, consumers are now purchasing a repertoire of products to fill specific needs, instead of purchasing just one product. To illustrate: whereas ten years ago a typical household would have had just one type of milk in the fridge, a household today might buy cow’s milk, high-protein milk, and a plant-based alternative such as almond milk or oat milk—each for a unique occasion.
Demanding sustainability and affordability
Consumers are gravitating toward sustainable products: 84 percent say that sustainability is a very important factor in their purchase decisions. However, 50 percent say they’re not sure whether they would pay a premium for sustainable products in times of inflation.
Still, products making sustainability-related claims are growing faster than products that make no such claims. Companies face the challenge of striking a balance between sustainability and price, which is especially critical in an inflationary environment.
Three business imperatives
In addition to keeping their finger on the pulse of the ever-more-demanding consumer, businesses should respond to these trends with their own ands. Companies need to be uncompromising in the following three areas.
Choose growth and manage uncertainty
Approximately 60 percent of top-performing CEOs are concerned about an economic downturn. Even amid the highest global inflation since the 1970s, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and volatile commodity prices, investors continue to expect profitable growth above the historical average. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, CEOs have a unique opportunity to make distinctive decisions that lift their companies above competitors. Fortune favors the bold, and pursuing growth must be a conscious, strategic choice.
Companies are more likely to outperform peers when they pursue multiple pathways to growth, including expanding into new categories and new geographies. Changing global demographics, in particular, are unlocking new growth opportunities. Consider that Africa will account for more than half of global population growth in the coming decades, and that GDP for both China and India continues to climb in global rankings. Companies that successfully expand into new geographies are 22 percent more likely to achieve above-market, accretive growth.
Build scale and pursue personalization
Companies that wish to keep up must speed up—and scale up. The pandemic created a greater chasm between retail leaders and laggards: more than 90 percent of growth in retail market cap was driven by 25 large, tech-forward retailers. We expect further market consolidation, accelerated by the end of cheap capital.
But scale must not come at the expense of personalization. The bigger your company, the better you should get at localizing and personalizing your offerings. More than 70 percent of consumers expect personalization and are frustrated when companies don’t deliver it. Companies that excel at personalization generate 40 percent more revenue from those activities than average players.
Grow your core and expand your ecosystem
Historically, more than 80 percent of consumer companies’ growth has come from core offerings. Clearly, nurturing the core isn’t optional—and we’ve found, in fact, that many companies underestimate the core’s growth potential.
But as consumer behaviors diverge, companies must seek to become indispensable in consumers’ lives by expanding beyond products and into a range of services. Companies would do well to start pursuing “share of life,” not just share of wallet. Traditional sector barriers are falling; McKinsey research suggests that one-third of global GDP will soon come from ecosystems (which are networks or partnerships that cut across different industries). And consumers are receptive: for example, 60 percent of European consumers say they’re willing to buy services from retailers they trust. Companies can also tap into B2B opportunities—an excellent example being the rise of retail media networks, which generate a significant amount of incremental revenue and operating margins as well as generating valuable new consumer insights.

Consumers today live in a world of ands—they’re much more demanding and less willing to make trade-offs. Businesses, too, should live in a world of ands. If they take an uncompromising stance on the three aforementioned imperatives, the payoff will be above-average growth and healthy margins.Sajal KohliSenior Partner, ChicagoLinkedInEmailThe author wishes to thank Christina Adams, Kari Alldredge, Ali Bergmann, Dallas Cullen, Warren Teichner, Björn Timelin, and Anja Weissgerber for their contributions to this article.

There's no question about it: consumer behavior is changing faster than ever before.
Specifically, what consumers want, where they want it, and when they want to access their products and services are constantly in flux.
In this report, we're going to cover 9 of the most important consumer behavior trends in 2024 (and beyond).
1. Consumers Expect Multiple Payment Options
As people increasingly shop online, they also expect a wide selection of different payment options from online retailers.
This includes offering different ways to pay (like accepting credit, debit, and PayPal payments).
But also the ability to defer payments over time. 
In fact, the ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" (BNPL) industry is growing alongside the general growth in eCommerce as a whole.
Searches for ""BNPL"" have grown by 843% over the last 5 years. 
And there's no shortage of fintech startups cropping up to meet the demand for BNPL at checkout.
Afterpay (known as Clearpay in the UK) is one of the leaders in this category.
But there are several others, like Sezzle, making serious inroads.
Searches for ""Sezzle"" have grown by 200% over the last 5 years.
2. Shoppers Want Everything Delivered
Over the last few years, we've seen a surge in products delivered to the home.
Including products that were traditionally only bought in-store, including:

Eyeglasses (Warby Parker)
Workout equipment (Peloton)
Groceries (Instacart)
Shoes (Allbirds)

The best example of this trend might be the DTC mattress category.
Brands like Nectar Mattress have seen rapid growth largely by delivering a product that was previously seen as too large and bulky to deliver to people's homes.
Then the pandemic happened.
Searches for ""Nectar Mattress"" over the last 5 years. 
And suddenly, consumers expected everything delivered to their doorstep.
The plant delivery space is a great example of the ""everything delivered"" trend.
Searches for ""plant delivery"" spiked at the start of the pandemic. 
Plants are difficult to ship.
But, like essentially all products, consumers now want them delivered anyway.
And a handful of companies that have pounced on this demand (like Bloom & Wild), have seen rapid growth.
3. Increased Demand for Ethical and Sustainable Products
According to research by IBM, 77% of consumers consider sustainability and environmental responsibility to be at least ""moderately important"" brand values.

Consumers support environmentally responsible products.
Harvard Business School report that sustainable products have 5.6x higher average sales growth compared to those that aren't marketed as sustainable.
So there's no question that sustainable products from ethical companies is one of the biggest consumer behavior trends to keep an eye on over the next 3-4 years.
An example of a growing sustainable product category is bamboo toilet paper.

Searches for ""bamboo toilet paper"" spiked during COVID. But is still seeing growth (113% in 5 years).
Unlike traditional toilet paper, bamboo toilet paper is sourced from a plant with a relatively small negative environmental impact: bamboo.
(This category's growth is also due to the fact that companies started to offer at-home bamboo toilet paper delivery.)
Consumers not only want products that are sustainable.
They also want to buy from brands that act ethically. 
In fact, a recent survey found that 32% of US and UK consumers would pay more for the same product if that product came from an ethical brand.
4. People Take Care of Their Health At Home
Telemedicine usage surged during the pandemic.
Some estimates say that the number of telemedicine appointments increased by 5,000% during the height of the pandemic.
However, doctor visits are just one of many areas of health and wellness that have shifted largely to the home.
Another growing at-home health trend is at-home spa treatments. 
Even though many spas have reopened (albeit with restrictions), we're seeing continued demand for spa treatments that can be done at home.
For example, Dermaplaning.
Searches for ""Dermaplaning"" have increased by 2,400% over the last 10 years.
Dermaplaning is a skincare treatment usually done at a spa or a dermatologist's office.
But consumers are now using at-home kits to take this skincare routine into their homes.
We're also seeing consumers replace their gym with at-home versions.
Searches for ""garage gym"" spiked during lockdowns.
Global Google search growth for ""garage gyms"".
Even with gyms now open, interest in at-home gyms hasn't completely died down.
That leads us to our next consumer behavior trend.
5. Influencers Increasingly Influence Buying Decisions
Millennials and Gen Z consumers continue to rely on influencers for product discovery.
And for choosing which brands to trust.
In fact, according to Influencer Marketing Hub, the influencer marketing market has increased year-over-year, reaching an estimated $13.8 billion in 2021.
This is why influencer marketing is still a growing marketing channel.
And one that many marketers rely on.
However, the way consumers interact with and buy from influencers is changing.
Specifically, consumers now seek out recommendations from social media influencers that may only have a small, niche audience.
An industry study by HypeAuditor found that social accounts between 1k-5k followers get 2x more relative engagement on each post than influencers with a larger following.
This is why we're seeing an increasing number of brands seek out ""micro influencers"".
Searches for ""micro influencers"", who are influencers with <50k followers on a given platform, have increased by 7,800% over 10 years.
A recent report found that 40% of brands that use influencer marketing have decided to partner with a micro influencer over a traditional influencer.
6. Consumers Subscribe to More Monthly Services
The monthly subscription industry has grown rapidly with subscribers increasing by 90% year-over-year.
This growth is largely due to the fact that consumers are more open to subscribing to monthly products and services than ever before. 
And, from Amazon Prime to video streaming services, there's now a wide array of monthly subscription products to choose from.
For example, video games have historically been one-off purchases.
You see a game that you want. Buy it at a one-time price. And play the game for an unlimited amount of time.
This is still largely the case.
But we're also seeing Sony, Microsoft, and other gaming industry giants roll out subscription gaming services. 
Which are essentially the Netflix for video games.
For example, Sony's PS Now service streams hundreds of titles for a monthly subscription fee. And it quickly grew to 3.2 million+ subscribers.
Searches for ""PS Now"" had been rising over the last 5 years before a recent dip. 
Other examples of this consumer trend include monthly boxes, streaming services, and meditation apps.
7. Consumers Spend More on Their Pets
The US pet furniture market size alone is worth over $2 billion.
And pet owners are now more willing than ever to shell out big bucks to increase their pets’ quality of life.
The pet market is growing steadily.
And a growing piece of the industry is based on luxury products.
For example, CBD for dogs, organic cat food, and devices for owners to video-call their pets.
Search growth for ""CBD for dogs"" is up 1,400% in 10 years.
No matter the product: if it will make their pets happier, there’s likely going to be a group of owners who will buy it.
A few more examples:
If Fido has too much ice cream (or too many Starbucks Puppuccinos) you can buy him a dog treadmill.
Or help him get back in balance with some raw dog food or dog supplements.
Searches for “dog supplements” have been rising each year.
If Fido still isn’t back in shape after that, it may be time to buy some pet insurance.
But why are people spending so much on their pets now?
Like many consumer behavior trends over the past year, the answer is: probably the pandemic.
Owners are more willing to buy luxury pet products having recently seen their pets more often.
The trend has been growing for longer than that, though.
As a long-term movement, luxury pet products are most likely related to the fact that fewer people are having children. (And opting for “fur babies” instead.)
Which is a larger trend that’s expected to continue worldwide.
8. The Mindfulness Market Continues to Grow
The global meditation market is expected to grow from $4.08 billion in 2019 to $9 billion in 2027 (at a 10.4% CAGR).
Growth of the meditation market into 2027.
Calm is an app that offers short, themed meditations for increasing concentration or tackling difficult emotions.
And outside of its regular meditations, Calm features the voices of celebrities like LeBron James and Matthew McConaughey.
Calm has a free basic plan as well as a premium membership for $69.99 per year.
To date, the company has raised $218 million in VC funding.
One of Calm’s biggest competitors is Headspace, founded in London in 2010 but now headquartered in California.
Headspace gets new users started with a 10-day introductory course to guided meditation. It also features “mindfulness workouts” and physical stretching exercises.
Headspace’s pricing is similar to Calm’s, with a $69.99 annual subscription as well as a $12.99 monthly option.
The company has raised $215.9 million to date, including $100.7 million in equity and $40 million in debt in 2020.
Waking Up is another example. The guided meditation app features Sam Harris, author of the NYT bestselling book of the same name.
Its price is higher than Calm and Headspace, at $99.99 per year.
Searches for “Waking Up app” are up 1,225% in 10 years.
The Ten Percent Happier meditation app is also based on a bestselling book. It offers a free version as well as a $99/year membership.
Ten Percent Happier has raised $8.1 million to date.
Google searches for ""Ten Percent Happier"" are up 600% in 5 years.
Inner Explorer has designed a mindfulness system and app for teachers.
The non-profit’s daily exercises are currently used by over 5,000 schools and reach more than 1.7 million students.
Which they say has led to 28% higher student grades and a 43% decrease in teacher-reported stress.
Other popular meditation apps include Insight Timer (for which searches have increased 85% in five years) and Breethe (for which searches are up 30%).
Biofeedback startups are taking a different approach to the mindfulness space.
Biofeedback consists of monitoring your body’s reactions (like heartbeat, breathing, and brain activity) so that you can try to control your stress, emotions, motivation, or ability to focus.
Research shows that biofeedback may even help treat conditions like migraines and high blood pressure.
One interesting biofeedback startup is Muse.
Muse makes EEG headbands designed to help users meditate and sleep better. Combined with its companion app, the device plays the sound of peaceful weather as you focus on your breathing. When your mind wanders, the noises turn stormy to remind you to relax.
The startup has raised $39.9 million since it was founded in 2007.
The Muse 2 EEG headband.
EMOTIV makes similar EEG headbands but is designed to monitor stress and help users focus.
Dreem’s headbands are made to aid sleep.
And MindLabs raised a $1.4 million pre-seed round to launch its “Peloton for mental health”. Which will consist of EEG headbands, guided meditations, and live video courses.
While Halo Neuroscience works in the opposite direction. Rather than simply measuring brain activity, the company’s “Halo Sport” device generates an electrical current to stimulate the wearer’s brain.
According to the company, its technology can improve performance in activities like learning guitar, endurance cycling, and playing piano.

Growing low-tech mindfulness practice is personal journaling.
Journaling is said to help people manage anxiety, focus on priorities, reduce distractions, and identify opportunities for growth.
And it’s been recommended by famous personalities like Oprah Winfrey and Tim Ferriss.
That may be why search interest in journaling is up over 5 years:
Searches for ""journaling"" are up 133% in 10 years.
Journaling habits range from free-form writing to trademarked practices like “Morning Pages” and the Bullet Journal, to other structured forms like gratitude journaling.
Searches for “gratitude journal” have increased by 138% in 5 years.
Here are a few players in the journaling space:
Jour is a guided journaling app that’s used by over 800k people. The startup raised a $1.8 million seed round.
Intelligent Change has sold over 1 million copies of its structured physical journals, “The Five Minute Journal” and “Productivity Planner”. It also sells app versions of them.
And Glimpses is a Windows-based journaling tool that syncs with Dropbox.
9. The Home Becomes The Hub
The average North American adult spends 90% of their time indoors.
And with more people working from home than ever before, this number may be on the rise.
And all of this time spent living and working at home is already starting to shift consumer behavior in unexpected ways.
For example, the rise of the smart doorbell.
Searches for ""smart doorbells"" have increased by 96% over the last 5 years.
As people spend more time at home, they realize that their home security may not be up to par, that they want to see their entire home exterior in real-time, and that their online shopping deliveries are at risk on the front steps.
This is why we're seeing increased demand for smart doorbell products, like Amazon's Ring.
Another example of this trend is the increasing number of searches related to cooking.
For example, searches for the product ""air fryer"" have increased over the last five years.
Searches for ""air fryers"" have increased by 426% over the last half-decade.
Conclusion
Many of these consumer behavior trends were already here before the coronavirus struck. But the COVID pandemic put many of these trends into overdrive.
That said, we can expect many of these trends to be sustained long-term.
One thing that ties many of these trends together is a focus on convenience. Consumers are increasingly willing to invest in products and services that save them time and effort. Even if they have to pay a premium to do it.
Another feature that many of these trends have in common is a renewed focus on customer experience. As consumers increasingly opt for digital channels for browsing and buying, brands need to make sure that their digital experience is on par with what someone would get in-store.Find Thousands of Trending Topics With Our PlatformTry Exploding Topics ProExploreAdd a TopicNewsletterBlogAffiliatesCompanyHomeAboutContactConnect548 Market St. Suite 95149 San Francisco, CaliforniaPrivacy NoticeTerms of Service© 2024  Exploding Topics"

Three Digital Shopping Trends to Watch in 2024




Three Digital Shopping Trends to Watch in 2024
2/14/2024





Michelle Evans

Share:










This article originally appeared in Forbes.
Out of the eight billion people in the world today, 64% use the internet, double the rate from a decade ago. Internet access has disrupted consumer life, including how they shop. Euromonitor International forecasts that consumers will spend nearly USD11 trillion on goods and services bought online in 2024.
This growing digital base needs to be at the center of your retail strategy. At NRF 2024: Retail’s Big Show in January, I spoke about the digital shopper trends that will have the biggest impact on retailers and brands. Let’s break down three big ones to watch in 2024.
Intuitive E-Commerce
The rising influence of digital channels is putting pressure on companies to improve the online experience. This is becoming possible due to evolving data-gathering strategies and emerging technologies, from AR to IoT to generative AI. These advances have the potential to transform the online shopping experience, leading to one that is more intuitive.
Consumers have greater expectations. About half of digital consumers want one-of-a-kind offerings. A fifth note the desire for more personalized shopping experiences. In both cases, these sentiments are higher among the most digitally savvy population, according to Euromonitor’s consumer research. That is telling as this shift toward a more intuitive experience is playing out on digital channels where these consumers shop more frequently.
In part, this means ensuring the online channel is more akin to what a consumer might experience in person. While a variety of data and tech will be used, generative AI is poised to take on a central role in shaping the online experience. Generative AI can be leveraged in a variety of ways, from improving customer service to tailoring marketing messages to optimizing supply chains.
Virtual assistants powered by generative AI can create a more intuitive experience by using additional information sources for added context. Zalando’s new chatbot offers suggestions based on natural questions the shopper might ask, and in the future, could be combined with personal preferences, taking steps toward making the discovery experience feel more intuitive.
Almost half of industry professionals say they plan to invest in generative AI in the next five years

New technologies like generative AI could give brands a competitive advantage. The pioneers who can create a next-generation shopping experience using these advances will be the ones that fuel a new shopping behavior and usher in the next so-called “Uber moment.”
TikTok Economy
Digital consumers are flocking to TikTok and its Chinese sister platform, Douyin. Brands are striving to promote their products and services on these platforms known for their short-form video content, but some of the viral trends that are doing the most to boost brand sales are emerging organically from users on those platforms.
These ByteDance platforms are not only some of the most popular, but also the fastest growing. As of 2023, 43% of digital consumers globally report using them monthly, a 19-percentage-point jump in three years, according to Euromonitor’s Voice of the Consumer: Digital Survey. These short-form video platforms, also known for their endless scroll and advanced algorithms, are a hit with young consumers, especially Gen Z.
Although most marketing campaigns on TikTok are financed or initiated by brands, some of the most viral content is organic. In 2023, an Israeli TikTok influencer posted a video of herself wrapping a frozen Betty Crocker Fruit Roll-Up processed snack around ice cream to create a crunchy fruit-flavored ice cream cone. Almost overnight, Fruit Roll-Ups began flying off shelves, creating a black market.
ByteDance platforms are dabbling in retail. In 2020, Douyin pivoted from being a pure social media platform to a retailer, prioritizing smaller sellers with a low-fee structure with revenue supplemented by advertising. Douyin has seen massive e-commerce gains. Online sales of beauty and personal care products on Douyin’s marketplace surged 81% in the first nine months of 2023, as compared with the same period in 2022, according to Euromonitor’s new e-commerce research. As for TikTok, its TikTok Shop is finding success in Southeast Asia and set up shop in the US and UK in September.
Revamped Returns
Consumers have long wanted hassle-free returns but delivering on that expectation has not been without challenges. The convergence of trends, like the rise of e-commerce, closure of stores by some retail chains and boost in sustainable strategies, is moving returns up the industry agenda. New technologies and partnerships are paving the way to a happier return experience for shoppers.
Creating a hassle-free return experience is not without challenges. First, what is deemed hassle-free varies by consumer. Although 43% of digital consumers point to mail as the preferred channel for online purchase returns, preferences vary by generation. For example, baby boomers prefer to return by mail, while Gen Z prefer to return in-store. To solve the unhappy return experience, the industry needs to shift its mindset, viewing this as being about improving loyalty, rather than a revenue drain.
Retailers are deploying a variety of tactics to reduce returns or at least their impact on the bottom line. Electronics specialist Best Buy is opening 10 smaller outlets, specializing in selling used and refurbished electronics. The aim of these stores is to target budget-conscious shoppers and recoup more from open-box and return products. More and more retailers are outsourcing the return experience to companies like Happy Returns or Loop Returns, which provide merchants with a customizable online portal for returns and exchanges.
To date, many retailers have struggled to grasp the pivotal role returns play in shaping customer loyalty and, as such, have sidelined this moment. That’s changing.

Looking ahead
These trends demonstrate how online shopping continues to mature, improving the customer experience from the moment of discovery to potential product return. A second, prominent theme is how consumers desire more power in their relationship with brands. TikTok Economy is rooted in how consumers are using social media to gain power in the value exchange. This power has led to more authentic messaging, which resonates with younger consumers like Gen Z.
As you begin to execute your 2024 strategy, use these insights to guide your campaigns, decisions and growth plans with the most digitally savvy consumers.

The 4 Biggest Consumer Behavior Shifts of 2023 [According to New Data]

Your marketing strategy can't stay stagnant if the people you're selling to are changing their behavior — you have to adapt and learn how to cater to them. Marketers should look for observable differences in buyer behavior to continue meeting their needs.

To help marketers and other business professionals make more data-informed decisions, we've conducted a bi-annual survey of 600+ U.S. consumers to better understand how adults spend their money.
Using HubSpot Blog Research from our Consumer Trends Report, we'll explore the nature of the biggest consumer behavior changes between May 2022 and January 2023 so that you can keep up.

Biggest Consumer Behavior Shifts
1. Consumers are warming up to purchasing products through social media apps.
In May 2022, only 12% of consumers preferred purchasing products through social media apps like Instagram Shop or Facebook Marketplace. In the past three months, 41% of social media users have shared that they feel comfortable purchasing on social media platforms.
That behavior shift is astounding. More than ever, social media marketers are more likely to impact consumer behavior by sharing content that builds interest and trust through these channels.

HubSpot Blog Research also found that the most popular social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, are the most preferred platforms for social shopping. Social shoppers also say Instagram and Facebook have the best in-app shopping experience.
These apps have very easy-to-use shopping interfaces, and it's plain to see why they can sell or influence users. When consumers watch or interact with the content they enjoy and receive ads relevant to their interests, the products seem more valuable to their hobbies and lifestyles.









































2. Gen X and Boomers are shopping through social media more, not just younger gens.
29% of Gen X (up 16% from May 2022) and 16% of Boomers (up 60%) say social media is their preferred product discovery channel. This shift is huge for generations that typically claim to prefer learning about products through TV ads and internet search.

Social media usage isn't just something teens use every day. Older generations use it just as often. Social networking provides entertainment, community, and a more dedicated space for window shopping.
3. Support for small businesses isn't dying down — it's growing.
42% of consumers have chosen a product based on it being made by a small business in the last three months, up 8% from May 2022.

The later effects of the pandemic may be behind this behavior shift. Many consumers saw some of their favorite mom-and-pop shops close due to lost funds from decreased traffic and customers. Now that the worst of COVID is over, many consumers haven't forgotten to support smaller businesses.
Another reason for supporting small businesses is the shopping experience itself. Many consumers enjoy shopping small due to:

Product diversity that chains don't offer
More hands-on and personable customer service
The positive feeling of giving back and building a community

4. Consumers are shopping more consciously, supporting businesses with corporate responsibility.
Along with support for the local community, consumers are giving more of their money to companies that take a political stand on issues they care about. These three causes are among the most important to them:

Racial justice
Climate change initiatives
LGBTQ+ rights 

Consumers want to support a company that pays it forward. They want to impact the world around them as they become more informed on news of global political unrest and other issues.
Businesses have much to gain from implementing socially responsible initiatives, programs, or donations to attract and retain customers. It may be the leading decision factor behind your next customer's purchase between you and your competitor.
Keep Up with Consumer Behavior Trends
One of the most significant risks a marketing team can make is failing to adapt to changing consumer behavior shifts. Stay informed on your customers' behaviors and ensure you meet their needs — even as they change.

And run innovative marketing campaigns that can catch your audience’s attention.But it’s important to adopt them before they become mainstream. If you’re late to the game, your marketing might not feel unique or new to your customers.We’ve put together this list of seven hot marketing trends you should look out for in 2024.But before we dive into these trends, let’s start with the basics.What Are Marketing Trends & Why Are They Important?Marketing trends are shifts within the marketing industry that become popular because they’re effective, innovative, and responsive to changing consumer behaviors and market conditions.These trends can be related to channels, tactics, and technological advancements. Or just about anything that can change the way companies approach marketing.Knowing about the latest marketing industry trends and adopting them early can help you stay ahead of your competitors. And also position your brand as a leader in your industry or niche. Now, let’s dive into our list of the top seven marketing trends to factor into your 2024 marketing strategy.7 Emerging Marketing Trends to Know About1. Marketers Will Fine-Tune Their Application of AI ToolsMarketers are increasingly seeing artificial intelligence (AI) tools as assistants to help them do their day-to-day tasks better and faster. That includes things like creating content, analyzing data, and coding. When ChatGPT became publicly available in late 2022, most users saw it as a way to create content fully from scratch. So they could rapidly scale content production. In response to the influx of AI-generated content, Google rolled out a series of core updates. Including several focused on prioritizing helpful, reliable, people-first content in Google search. Companies that published AI-generated content without making significant edits, conducting fact-checking, and adding human insights saw a decline in search engine rankings.This is clear from an experiment by SEO veteran Mark-Williams Cook who published 10K pages of both scraped and AI-generated content on a website. While the content initially performed well, the site took a significant hit after Google’s updates rolled out.He shared the results via LinkedIn:Because of cases like this, there’s been a paradigm shift in how marketers and companies are viewing Generative AI tools. One interesting application is using tools like Semrush’s ContentShake AI to generate an outline for your blog posts or other online copy.Just open the tool and fill out some basic information about the type of content you’ll be creating.You can then select one of the suggested ideas to write articles faster and optimize your copy. The tool can even publish directly to your WordPress blog or site. Beyond content, here are some other ways marketing teams currently use AI tools: Segmenting customers into distinct groups—by preferences, demographics, and behavior—to target marketing efforts more effectively Analyzing large datasets for predictions about customer behavior and the market Understanding the sentiment of social media mentions and customer reviews to assess marketing and product performance Looking at existing customer data to identify common pain points and preferences Creating code that nontechnical marketers can implement on their sitesIn 2024 and beyond, marketers are expected to continue exploring and testing AI tools in innovative ways to drive better results. 2. Brands That Focus on High-Quality Content Will WinPublishing high-quality content has always been helpful for making your brand stand out, building trust with your audience, and positioning you as an authority. But the prevalence of unedited AI-generated content and other low-quality content makes it even more true. Why?Because low-quality content can have the opposite effect that high-quality content does.Such content is less likely to help you achieve your content marketing goals. For instance,many brands go overboard with mentioning their products/services in their blog posts. Which feels pushy, self-serving, and lacking in authenticity.Today’s consumers can see right through this bias.This low-quality, overtly promotional content is likely behind the surge in the number of Reddit-specific queries. Which you can see here in a chart from Google Trends. Attributed to people looking for authentic and reliable information:Knowing many companies are trying to get by with publishing work that isn’t truly valuable, it’s worth it to focus on quality. Follow these tips to improve the quality of your content: Interview subject matter experts (SMEs) to gather unique and valuable insights you can’t find elsewhere Add relatable examples for inspiration  Write easy-to-follow steps and offer practical advice  Focus on readability, structure, and visuals Maintain a consistent and relevant tone of voice3. More Businesses Will Invest in Nano- or Micro-Influencer MarketingMore brands are likely to collaborate with nano- and micro-influencers in the near future (as opposed to working with celebrities or high-profile social media creators). Because these influencers typically charge lower rates and can generate high engagement rates.In fact, the Influencer Marketing Hub’s 2024 State of Influencer Marketing report reveals that there’s a strong preference among marketers and businesses for working with small-scale influencers.Let’s talk about rates first.Nano-influencers (1,000 to 10,000 followers) charge anywhere between $5 and $25 for a TikTok post, According to a separate report from Influencer Marketing Hub. And micro-influencers (10,000 to 50,000 followers) charge $25 to $125 macro-influencers (500,000 to 1 million followers) quote between $1,250 and $2,500 for a TikTok post.Another benefit of collaborating with small-scale influencers is their higher average engagement rates. According to Aspire’s The State of Influencer Marketing 2024, nano-influencers boast the highest engagement rates. Which means followers are more likely to take action and convert based on small-scale influencers’ recommendations.NoteTo increase the odds of achieving a positive return on investment (ROI) with your influencer marketing campaigns, it’s important to collaborate with influencers whose followers resemble your target audience.To find the right influencers for your brand, use Semrush’s Influencer Analytics tool. It lets you discover influencers based on your specific criteria. And possibly identify emerging players in the field to stay ahead of the curve.Further reading: How to Find Influencers for Your Brand (Not Just on Instagram)4. Companies Will Invest in Partnership MarketingMore brands are likely to partner with other companies in their industry. Because it can help both parties achieve their goals.It might involve co-producing and co-promoting webinars, making guest appearances on each other’s podcasts, collaborating on industry reports, mutually sharing social media content, etc.For example, ecommerce video platform Videowise collaborated with other brands to promote their ebook:Here’s how partnership marketing can help you: Reach more potential customers: Partnering with other companies in your industry lets you tap into their audience. This can help you put your brand in front of more potential customers. Connect with industry leaders: Building partnerships gives you the opportunity to connect with industry leaders who you can engage with in a few ways. Like getting their thoughts on current marketing trends or seeking assistance in creating specific processes.  Get access to more resources: Collaborating with other companies can grant you access to valuable resources they use in their marketing. Think customer insights, industry data, etc., which can help you discover opportunities and come up with ideas to enhance your marketing campaigns.5. More Marketers Will Look to User-Generated Video ContentThere’s a good chance we’ll see more user-generated video content going forward. Because potential customers are more likely to trust it over high-production videos from the brand pushing the product or service. User-generated videos come from real customers who have actually used the brand’s product or service. So, those videos carry a level of authenticity that really resonates with audiences. And makes them more likely to become customers.For example, Dr. Squatch, an ecommerce brand that sells organic and natural handmade soap for men, has incorporated user-generated videos on its website:Focusing on this type of content can be very cost-effective. Because you don’t have to spend anything on producing it. That said, you may want to lightly edit these videos to meet your needs. But you’ll spend less time, money, and effort than if you were creating highly produced videos from scratch.But what if buyers don’t actively post their experiences with your products or services? Figure out ways to encourage them to do so. Here are a few tips: Ask them: Just send customers a quick message asking them to record an honest review. You might want to include this mention in confirmation emails. Host a giveaway contest: Invite customers to be a part of your giveaway by sharing a video testimonial for your product or service. With a chance to win a prize in return. Work with creators: Cut your high-production video content budget and instead allocate it to creators who’ll share their genuine opinion in exchange for a fee. Here’s an example:6. Shorter Video Content Will Be PrioritizedBrands will increasingly focus on short video content like the kind used on TikTok and in Instagram Reels. Because those videos do a great job of capturing and holding people’s attention.Wistia’s 2023 State of Video report reveals that the length of videos is inversely proportional to their average engagement rate. Those under 60 seconds have a 50% average engagement rate while videos that are longer than 60 minutes have just a 16% average engagement rate.This is probably because short videos are easy to digest and provide immediate answers to viewers’ questions.The same report further reveals that videos under 60 seconds were the most popular type created in 2022. Meaning there’s a strong preference among marketers for short-form video content.You can find inspiration for short-form video topics using Keyword Analytics for YouTube.Open the tool and click “Get started” under “Keywords Research.”Then, enter a keyword related to your niche in the search bar and click “Search.”You’ll then get a list of related terms and relevant information about each, including the top videos. And you can click through those videos to see them on YouTube to learn how long they are, how many views they have, etc.7. Brands Will Change Their Approach to Social Media MarketingRather than trying to be everywhere, brands are increasingly prioritizing social media platforms that are most likely to help them reach their goals.This is happening because many companies have realized that not every platform helps them reach their target audience effectively. Let’s say you use One2Target to study your target audience based on your top competitors and see that they primarily use YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Based on this, you might choose to focus your efforts on just those three channels to increase the odds of reaching the right people. And reducing the odds of spreading yourself too thin. Here are some other ways to better understand which social media platforms to build your presence on:  Talk to your customers to understand which platforms influence their purchasing decisions  Speak with industry leaders in your space Consider the resources you have for social media marketingAlways Stay Ahead of the CurveStaying on top of the above marketing trends is essential if you want your business to remain relevant. But it’s also a good idea to keep tabs specifically on your top competitors to understand how they’re adjusting their efforts. Which can alert you to emerging trends.Semrush’s EyeOn tool lets you track your competitors’ activities like newly published blog posts, recent social media posts, and more.Try it today. ShareFind Keyword Ideas in SecondsBoost SEO results with powerful keyword researchFree Keyword Research Tool"

Skip to main contentThe great consumer shift: Ten charts that show how US shopping behavior is changingAugust 4, 2020 | Article Tamara Charm Becca Coggins Kelsey Robinson Jamie WilkieOur research indicates what consumers will continue to value as the coronavirus crisis evolves. (13 pages)
Anyone who has hosted a game night over video chat or ordered groceries to be delivered at home for the first time understands how profoundly the COVID-19 crisis has changed our behavior as consumers. But which of these changes will stick? We see several that are key:

Flight to online
Shock to loyalty
Need for hygiene transparency
Back to basics and value
Rise of the homebody economy

We’ve boiled down extensive McKinsey consumer research into ten exhibits to illustrate the trends and the consumer segments associated with each.
Flight to online
1. Digital shopping is here to stay
Physical distancing and stay-at-home orders have forced whole consumer segments to shop differently. A few months into COVID-19, consumer shopping online has increased significantly across many categories. Consumer intent to shop online continues to increase, especially in essentials and home-entertainment categories. More interestingly, these habits seem like they’re going to stick as US consumers report an intent to shop online even after the COVID-19 crisis. Categories where expected growth in online shoppers exceeds 35 percent include essentials such as over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, groceries, household supplies, and personal-care products. Even discretionary categories such as skin care and makeup, apparel, and jewelry and accessories show expected customer growth of more than 15 percent.

2. Millennials and high-income earners are in the lead when it comes to shopping online
While the shift to online shopping has been near universal across categories, high-income earners and millennials are leading the way in shifting spend online across both essential and nonessential items. Gen X has experienced a similar online shift, although not at the same scale as millennials. Gen Z has concentrated its shift online in particular categories: apparel and footwear, at-home entertainment, and food takeout/delivery.

Shock to loyalty
3. Consumers are switching brands at unprecedented rates
The crisis has prompted a surge of new activities, with an astonishing 75 percent of US consumers trying a new shopping behavior in response to economic pressures, store closings, and changing priorities. This general change in behavior has also been reflected in a shattering of brand loyalties, with 36 percent of consumers trying a new product brand and 25 percent incorporating a new private-label brand. Of consumers who have tried different brands, 73 percent intend to continue to incorporate the new brands into their routine. Gen Z and high earners are most prone to switching brands.
The beneficiaries of this shift include big, trusted brands, which are seeing 50 percent growth during the crisis, and private labels, which have outpaced the retail market. Some 80 percent of customers who started using a private brand during the pandemic indicate they intend to continue using it once the COVID-19 crisis subsides.

4. Brands need to ensure strong availability and also convey value
Shoppers have cited a number of reasons for switching brands, with availability (in-store and online), convenience, and value leading the pack.
For marketers, this highlights the need to quickly become aware of when shoppers are migrating brands or retailers and then to manage the logistics to ensure product and service availability. Looking at China, which is further along in its recovery cycle than most countries, the increase in promotional activity to cater to consumers’ focus on value in apparel is expected to continue.

Need for hygiene transparency
5. US consumers are changing how they shop in response to health and safety concerns
As Americans contemplate going back out to shop, hygiene and hygiene transparency have emerged as important sources of concern. It is becoming increasingly important for stores and restaurants to not only follow hygiene protocols (thorough cleaning and masks for consumers and employees are top priorities) but also communicate effectively that they are following those procedures.
US consumers have already started to change their behavior in response to hygiene concerns. Technologies that enhance hygiene, particularly contactless activities such as food and grocery delivery and curbside pickup, are taking off. There is strong intent to continue contactless activities across the United States. As an example, 79 percent of consumers intend to continue or increase their usage of self-checkout in retail after COVID-19. Millennials and Gen Z are the widest adopters of contactless activities.
 5
Back to basics and value
6. Consumer shopping intent is focused on essentials
Around 40 percent of US consumers have reduced spending in general, and they expect to continue to cut back on nonessentials specifically. This reality reflects profound discomfort about the state of the economy.
With overall consumer spending declining, intent to spend in essential categories is increasing. Even among those with higher incomes, we see that while essentials show spending momentum, intent to buy discretionary products still lags significantly. As the worst of the crisis abates, we do see online spending in nonessential categories such as apparel and footwear starting to come back. This effect is strongest among high-income earners, consumers in the Northeast, and Gen Z.
 6
7. Consumers want value for their money—especially in essential categories
Tied to the concern about the state of the economy is an increasing consumer focus on value—especially for essential categories. For example, in shampoo on Amazon, value and mass products have experienced the greatest increase in share, at two- and five-percentage-points gains, respectively. Premium shampoo products have seen significantly less growth in comparison, losing more than five points of volume.

Rise of the homebody economy
8. Americans are changing how they spend their time at home
Americans are spending more of their at-home time on domestic activities, media, and news. Intent to eat more at home post-COVID-19 has strengthened significantly over the past three months. Usage of popular online entertainment platforms has skyrocketed. (The popular video game Fortnite recently hosted a concert that was “attended” by 12.3 million users.1Andrew Webster, “More than 12 million people attended Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert,” The Verge, April 23, 2020, theverge.com.) Investment in at-home fitness through equipment purchases and online activity is growing. Consumers still expect to spend more time on at-home activities, even in less-restricted regions.
 8
9. Americans are concerned about going back to regular activities outside the home
As economies reopen, 73 percent of consumers are still hesitant to resume regular activities outside the home. They are concerned about going to a hair salon, gym, or restaurant, but are especially worried about shared environments, such as public transportation, ride sharing, air travel, and being in crowded spaces, such as attending large indoor or outdoor events.

Behaviors vary by consumer segment
10. ‘Great consumer shift’ trends vary by consumer segment
US consumer-segment behavior varies significantly across the next-normal trends. We have identified five customer segments driven by optimism, health, and financial concerns, each of relatively similar size. These five segments exhibit the consumer trends to a different degree and have the following characteristics:
Affluent and unaffected: These consumers express general optimism about the future (~20 percent higher than the overall US consumer population), skew male (60 percent), and make more than $100,000 a year. They tend to be able to stay at home during the pandemic crisis, allowing them to shop more online. This group is slightly less price sensitive than other cohorts due to greater job stability.
Uprooted and underemployed: These consumers are feeling major impact on both their finances and health due to job insecurity. They are cautious about how they spend money, with low optimism about future economic conditions. Not surprisingly, this group is trading down to essentials and value, swapping out brands, and shopping online when possible.
Financially secure but anxious: This population is largely 65 years old and older and is generally pessimistic about economic conditions after COVID-19, which has had a major impact on their habits. This group has expressed the greatest need for hygiene transparency, with above-average concerns on safety and well-being and concerns about the ability to get necessary supplies.
Out trying to make ends meet: These consumers are being cautious about how they spend money and feel that their jobs and job security have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. This group has significant representation from minority groups and rural populations. They are less likely to be able to stay at home (hence their lower likelihood to be part of the homebody economy), but they are strongly moving toward shopping for essentials and value.
Disconnected and retired: This category denotes those who are retired, over 65, and have a lower income level than the financially-secure-but-anxious segment. They are broadly optimistic about economic conditions after COVID-19 and are less likely to display any of the next-normal characteristics. Predominantly from Southern and suburban areas of the country, this group has not exhibited significant changes in shopping behavior.
 10

As retailers contemplate the changes in consumer behavior, they will need to adjust their strategies and execution to adapt to the new norms, including:

Adjusting mix and spend to where the consumer is now (go digital, ensure full coverage of bottom-funnel marketing and demand capture, think region-by-region)
Revamping messaging and creative to be in sync with the times, particularly in terms of hygiene and value
Ensuring the end-to-end journey meets the new hygiene and at-home needs
Managing corporate social-responsibility efforts to build brand strength authentically
Refocusing on online and pickup solutions and rebuilding real-time measurement plans, as traditional media-mix models won’t suffice

Further, it will be important for brands to reevaluate and reprioritize their target audience and consumer segments, as the emphasis on each of the next-normal trends will vary based on the target consumer.Tamara Charm is a senior expert in McKinsey’s Boston office, where Jamie Wilkie is a partner; Becca Coggins is a senior partner in the Chicago office; and Kelsey Robinson is a partner in the San Francisco office.

Our experts explain how. (6 pages)
For many consumers around the world, a return to normalcy feels so close, yet so far away, in light of the alarming spread of COVID-19 variants. Although it’s unclear what the next 12 to 24 months will bring, what’s almost certain is that consumers won’t simply revert to doing exactly what they did in 2019. In this episode of the McKinsey on Consumer and Retail podcast, three consumer-behavior experts share their insights into how consumers’ spending patterns and purchasing behaviors are changing, and what companies should do given those changes. An edited transcript of the conversation with executive editor Monica Toriello follows. Subscribe to the podcast.

Monica Toriello: Over the past several weeks, people in some parts of the world have resumed their prepandemic habits. Maybe you’ve recently seen a movie at a theater, or flown on an airplane, or even just stopped for a cup of coffee on your way to the office for the first time in over a year. But a return to “normal” won’t look the same for everyone. Today, we’ll hear from three people who intensively study consumer behavior. They’ll share fascinating insights into how consumers are changing and what companies should do about it.

Kari Alldredge is a McKinsey partner based in Minneapolis. Kari has been advising consumer-goods companies for more than 20 years on a variety of topics, and she leads McKinsey’s work in consumer-goods growth transformation. She is an author of several articles, including a recent one on COVID-19’s impact on demand and costs in the consumer-packaged-goods [CPG] industry.
Anne Grimmelt is a senior knowledge expert in McKinsey’s Consumer Packaged Goods Practice. She is based in Stamford, Connecticut. Anne has been one of the driving forces behind McKinsey’s consumer-sentiment survey, which was launched in 2008 and during the pandemic has expanded to 45 countries. It provides a rich fact base for how consumers are feeling about their finances and how their buying behavior is changing.
And our third guest is Anjali Lai, a senior analyst at Forrester. Anjali, who is based in New York, helps chief marketing officers [CMOs] and other business leaders to understand the shifts in consumer
behavior and consumer decision making and then to figure out what these changes mean for the future of brands and industries.

A ‘reversal of fortune’ for big brands
Monica Toriello: Kari, Anne, Anjali, it’s great to have you here today. All three of you have been keeping your fingers on the pulse of consumers, both before and throughout the pandemic. Have there been any surprises? Are consumers doing things that you didn’t expect? Or is there anything that seemed to be going one way in, say, March or April 2020 but is going in a different direction today?
Kari Alldredge: In 2019 or early 2020, the topic on the minds of large branded consumer-packaged-goods manufacturers was portfolio shaping: how to reimagine their portfolios, how to move away from center-of-store food products and big brands and instead engage with consumers in very different, more targeted, niche-oriented ways. The degree to which the pandemic pushed people back toward big brands in the center of the store, and toward cooking at home, has been a complete turnaround, a reversal of fortune, for large CPG companies.
Some of those changes could have been anticipated, but others are quite shocking: the notion that bread baking would become a phenomenon among millennials, or that pet ownership would skyrocket to the extent that it has, and that those same millennials would be willing to spend more than they spend on their daily Starbucks to feed their new pets.
So, many of those companies that were desperately searching for growth 18 months ago now have the opposite problem: their supply chains can’t keep up. The big question for all of them is which of those consumer behaviors are truly going to persist and be “sticky” coming out of this pandemic? Certainly, the dog that you adopted is likely to stay at your home. But when you go back to ordering your daily Starbucks and spending $7 a day on a coffee, are you going to spend the same amount to feed your pet? Those are the questions that are on many company leaders’ minds.
Anne Grimmelt: As Kari said, we saw a complete shift. Prepandemic, the growth was in smaller, niche brands, but early in the pandemic, it was large CPG players that really gained scale because their products were available on the shelf. They were also brands that were trusted by consumers, so consumers felt good buying them. If you look at point-of-sale data from IRI or Nielsen, you see that large companies—those with more than $2.5 billion in retail sales in the US market—picked up most of the share growth early in the pandemic, whereas smaller and midsize companies, as well as private label, were really not picking up growth.
In the second half of 2020 and in early 2021, small and midsize companies are regaining their sales growth. And we expect that private label is going to be powerful again, because if you dive into the why—why did consumers pick a new brand, and why did they pick the brands they chose?—it was about availability, it was about purpose, but it was also about value. It was about price points. Going forward, value is going to be even more important, and private label will gain strength in the future.
Trust as a strategic imperative
Monica Toriello: All three of you to some extent have written about customer loyalty: how to win it and how to retain it, particularly in an environment where people are willing to try new brands. Anne and Kari, you found that 39 percent of consumers tried new brands during the pandemic. And Anjali, in your research, you found that small brands are particularly good at earning consumers’ trust and consequently their loyalty. In a recent blog post, you wrote, “Now is the time for companies to embrace trust as a strategic imperative.” What does that mean? How should companies do that?
Even relatively mundane CPG companies are thinking about the end-to-end consumer journey, including consumer experience pre- and postpurchase.Kari Alldredge
Kari Alldredge: I’m seeing two interesting things in response to the trends you just talked about, Anjali. One is the degree to which even relatively mundane CPG companies are thinking about the end-to-end consumer journey, including consumer experience pre- and postpurchase, as they try to understand how to serve their existing consumers but also look for new ways to better meet consumer needs. The notion that there is a pre- and postpurchase experience related to a can of soda or a can of soup is a relatively novel idea, right? But, increasingly, the most forward-thinking companies are doing research across that entire journey to be able to understand the needs of consumers as they’re considering the range of options that are available to them—all the way through to satisfaction with usage and even disposal of the packaging of products.
Another interesting thing I’m seeing is a recognition that marketing is a dialogue, and a recognition of the degree to which consumers now “own” or shape the narratives of many brands. This, too, was happening before the pandemic but was vastly accelerated during the pandemic. The notion that a marketer positions the brand and delivers a message and a promise to consumers is really becoming quite an antiquated one, I think, as consumers themselves—through reviews, ratings, blogs, videos, and social-media posts—shape the identity of many of these brands. Recommendations from friends and family become part of the brand’s identity and are critical to shaping both loyalty and consumer trust.
We found in our research that about 33 percent of millennial and Gen Z consumers say they choose to buy a brand from a company that has their values, versus about 12 percent of baby boomers.Anne Grimmelt
Anne Grimmelt: Our research corroborates that. We found in our research that about 33 percent of millennial and Gen Z consumers say they choose to buy a brand from a company that has their values, versus about 12 percent of baby boomers. But every demographic group is leaning toward that.
Another finding from our research is the reasons why consumers change to a new brand. It is definitely the younger generation that more often indicates that it’s because of purpose. It’s because of what the company stands for, how it treats its employees, et cetera.
Purpose: More than just a buzzword
Monica Toriello: We’ve been hearing a lot about purpose and values, but I also hear some skepticism in certain pockets of the corporate world as to whether an emphasis on corporate purpose actually pays off. Because there is an attitude–behavior gap, right? What’s your response to a CEO who says, “Consumers like to say they care about purpose and values, but when they’re at the point of deciding to buy something, they truly only care about convenience or price or quality. Purpose is just a buzzword.”
Kari Alldredge: It’s necessary but not sufficient. I think there’s an increasing recognition that alignment with a consumer’s values may put you in the consideration set but won’t drive you over the line to purchase. You still have to have product superiority, whether that’s taste superiority, functional superiority, or a price-to-value equation that works for that particular consumer.
We talk a lot about the pandemic, which definitely shone a light on health in general, but there are other crises—like social justice and climate change—that have come to light over the past year and a half and that have really shaken the corporate community. These crises have helped companies understand that some of these factors are fundamental in how consumers perceive themselves and the world around them, to the point where we now actually see some change happening.
One of the things that I was struck by was the speed and seriousness with which many of the household-cleaning companies responded to the pandemic and the heroic efforts to convert production capacity to manufacture things like wipes and sanitizer. Yes, some of that was for financial gain, but I think there really was an almost wartime mentality that I saw companies get new energy from.
I think about center-of-store food manufacturers who, prepandemic, maybe viewed themselves as being a bit sleepy and not exciting in terms of attracting the best talent. Now when you hear them talk about what they do, there’s real pride in the fact that they fed America, or they kept America safe. It really changed the way they think about the importance of what they do.

Sources of insight
Monica Toriello: All three of you are experts in consumer behavior. But consumers are changing fast and they’re changing constantly. Anjali, in another recent blog post, you wrote, “Rather than expect consumers to settle into a defined postpandemic normal, CMOs should prepare for a constant evolution of consumer needs and expectations over the next 12 to 24 months.” So beyond reading the latest consumer research and analysis, what are the best ways for CMOs and CEOs to understand where consumers are and where they’re headed?
Kari Alldredge: One of the best sources of insights is their online channel partners and their own D2C [direct to consumer] sites. Companies should mine online data to get a quick pulse on the way consumers are thinking or feeling. They should look at ratings and reviews using advanced analytics to understand and see trends and what’s selling on sites like Kroger.com, Walmart.com, or Amazon.com. They could even develop products that they can quickly test in an online environment and then change and adjust, as opposed to thinking about mass development of a product that gets pushed out to thousands and thousands of brick-and-mortar retail stores.
Consumers don’t always know what they want, and they can’t predict how their behavior will change. So traditional consumer research—which asks consumers how likely they are to purchase something—is becoming less relevant or reliable than actual data in market. That’s why data from e-commerce sites can be so valuable.
Anne Grimmelt: Another very powerful way to understand consumers is by looking at what your peer companies do. You can go to industry conferences like the CAGNY [Consumer Analyst Group of New York] conference and hear a company like L’Oréal talk about how they use their D2C and their online-sales platform to see what type of color lipstick people try—not buy, but try—on their online platform. That information is critical for them to know where to innovate. What are the colors that people want and what are the products that people like to try out on the digital platform?
Similarly, I think it’s very important to keep an open mind beyond your own borders, to realize what’s happening elsewhere in the world. Going back to the topic of purpose, for instance, it is very much alive in the US but it’s also very much alive in Europe. Learning about the power of what consumers demand and how purpose is driving consumer decisions about CPG companies—and what companies in Europe are doing to meet consumer demand—can be valuable, wherever you are in the world.
Kari Alldredge: I think we also shouldn’t underestimate the resilience of consumers and the gravitational pull of life as we knew it before the pandemic. One thing that surprised me even in the past several weeks is the degree to which behaviors have bounced back. If there’s anything I’ve learned over the past 18 months it’s that I don’t have a crystal ball, or if I did, it is certainly broken—because there is no part of this last 18 months that I ever could have in a million years predicted.
At the beginning of the pandemic, one company I work with asked every board member, “When you look back, what’s the one thing that will be blazingly obvious that we either should always have done or never have been doing?” And one of the things that came up was shaking hands: “We’re never going to shake hands again.” But I attended a graduation ceremony in the beginning of June—so, early into the recovery—and what was striking to me is that the dean of that school shook the hand of, and physically embraced, every single one of the thousand students who crossed that stage. And this was at an institution that had been, like most educational institutions, incredibly thoughtful and conservative about their public-health response. Literally days after restrictions were lifted, the urge to connect was so strong that it looked as if the pandemic had never happened.
People are resilient. Hundreds of years of behavior certainly have been meaningfully changed by the past 18 months, but I think a lot of the old behaviors will bounce back pretty quickly.

In many ways, 2020 marked a change in how digitalization impacted both individuals and businesses. Consumers have adjusted the way they live and work, and delivering on those consumer preferences has become the new business battleground. In fact, 70% of consumers believe that a business is only as good as its customer service, with 67% of customers willing to pay more for brands that offer better service.

Although some changes have merely accelerated the adoption of habits already emerging — such as a preference for personalization and digital-first interactions — other changes spell out a lot more introspection from brands. During my conversations with leaders from some of the world’s most influential brands, I uncovered three key trends that are forever reshaping customer expectations.


Digital Is Here To Stay

Today, customer journeys often begin with a digital experience, and they’re not limited to one specific channel. Since the pandemic began, digital interactions have replaced in-person experiences, so it’s not surprising to learn that live chat and chatbots are the fastest-growing channels globally. Although picking up the phone and calling customer service remains the most frequently used way to interact with brands, more than 40% of consumers now use live webchat, making it the second most popular channel. With this shift in consumer behavior, it’s no coincidence that digital-first customer service solutions have emerged as their own software category with customers flocking to digital channels.
What does that mean for your company? It means that investing in digital is no longer a nice-to-have, and offering self-service digital channels is a must. For example, financial institutions used to rely on clients visiting branch locations to have that personal connection with their financial consultants. That wasn’t possible for a while with Covid-19, so as a result, we’ve seen a dramatic uptick in digital channel usage.

One executive from a Fortune 500 financial institution told me that the company shifted its entire online CX strategy to let customers self-serve in a way that eliminated waiting time, but the customers never felt like the bank didn’t remember them or their history. Company leaders also noticed customers were increasingly tweeting questions about financial planning challenges, but it was hard to provide personalized help on such a public channel. The company deployed an omnichannel strategy that allowed for conversations to start anywhere, but then brought customers into a more comfortable, context-rich channel where they could have a realistic and candid conversation about their financial health.

The key to making this work in the real world is experience orchestration. With empowered agents that have visibility into the full customer journey — including historical transactions, previous customer service exchanges, preferred contact channels and movement from one channel to another — companies can deliver a truly connected experience while leveraging the power of digital.


Real-Time, Event-Driven Communication Is Expected
As we move into another phase of the pandemic with increasing in-person interactions and movement, it’s more critical than ever to unify and improve the customer experience across both physical and digital channels. A current example is curbside pickup — a shift in consumer behavior that’s predicted to likely outlast the pandemic. Popularized by big retailers like Walmart and Target, curbside pickup has since expanded beyond the grocery space, with nonessential retailers like Best Buy and Nordstrom offering the service as an option as consumer uptake continues.
Completing and coordinating successful curbside pickups require clear communication throughout the buying process. The key to making this work for your brand is a next-gen CX architecture that can easily allow data and context to be shared across business units and functions — from the warehouse to the POS, to a mobile app, to customer support and beyond.
Delivering successful omnichannel experiences is only possible when systems are connected across sales, marketing and service. As consumers continue to rely on digital for many transactions and services that can’t yet happen in person, maintaining a streamlined customer experience across all channels will play a pivotal role in purchasing decisions today and building long-term loyalty in the future.
Values Matter More Than Ever
The last year brought about a renewed sense of awareness of social causes amid the unique circumstances of the pandemic, environmental and social crises. Consumers around the world are adjusting their shopping habits in a quest to support businesses that are socially responsible.
Accessibility is a cornerstone of great customer experiences and great brands but is often overlooked as part of a sustainability program. Companies like Genesys partner Be My Eyes use video to allow blind and low-vision people to have someone else “see” for them to overcome access barriers. In addition to providing an enriching experience, this also makes good business sense. In fact, when it comes to the visually impaired, two-thirds of e-commerce transactions are abandoned due to a lack of accessibility.
Other companies getting it right include mindfulness app Headspace, which responded to the Covid-19 crisis by giving away free subscriptions to health care and unemployed workers. Also, Genesys client Airbnb recently announced that they will be housing 20,000 Afghan refugees globally for free.
For many, the post-Covid-19 world is an opportunity to rebuild for the better. Consumers are seeking more purpose-driven services and products. Companies that utilize the right technologies to communicate with customers at the right time and explore ways to use products and services for good may find themselves best positioned for the next normal.
